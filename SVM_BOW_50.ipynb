For these two were old friends, old mates both at school and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the complete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which were the leading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I was punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was conscious, even\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"to carry my head high, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public.

Under the strain of\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"to the wheel\\u2014if Jekyll will but let me,\\u201d he added, \\u201cif Jekyll will only let me.\\u201d For once more he saw before his mind\\u2019s eye, as clear as transparency, the strange clauses of the will. A fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his face, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and great apparent debility of constitution, and\\u2014last but not least\\u2014with the odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"and in such a strange array; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape and was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of breakfasting. Small indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal of my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court. The steps drew swiftly nearer,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"will? Yes, certainly, I know that,\\u201d said the doctor, a trifle sharply. \\u201cYou have told me so.\\u201d \\u201cWell, I tell you so again,\\u201d continued the lawyer. \\u201cI have been learning something of young Hyde.\\u201d The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"floor. \\u201cI can bear it no more,\\u201d he repeated. \\u201cCome,\\u201d said the lawyer, \\u201cI see you have some good reason, Poole; I see there is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is.\\u201d \\u201cI think there\\u2019s been foul play,\\u201d said Poole, hoarsely. \\u201cFoul play!\\u201d cried the lawyer, a\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"and I don\\u2019t like it, sir\\u2014I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I\\u2019m afraid.\\u201d \\u201cNow, my good man,\\u201d said the lawyer, \\u201cbe explicit. What are you afraid of?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ve been afraid for about a week,\\u201d returned Poole, doggedly disregarding the question, \\u201cand I can bear\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided. And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of hope. \\u201cThis Master Hyde, if he were studied,\\u201d thought he, \\u201cmust have secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"in my customary seat and with as fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness of the hour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had of my visitor, would suffer me to muster. \\u201cI beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,\\u201d he replied civilly\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"Jekyll. \\u201cWhat! Jekyll!\\u201d he cried. \\u201cI trust you are better.\\u201d \\u201cI am very low, Utterson,\\u201d replied the doctor drearily, \\u201cvery low. It will not last long, thank God.\\u201d \\u201cYou stay too much indoors,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cYou should be out, whipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me.

The next day, came the news that the murder had been overlooked, that the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was a man high in\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"had only used a couple of rooms; but these were furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with wine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung upon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who was much of a\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"forfeited, and the character of Edward Hyde become irrevocably mine.

And then all of a sudden he broke out in a great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman. The\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"it was madness,\\u201d he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper in the safe, \\u201cand now I begin to fear it is disgrace.\\u201d With that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his friend,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar sprawling wide upon his shoulders.

This brought them to the\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"minutes that still divided him from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box of lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled.

We heard\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"firm, however, and made preparations for my long vigil.

I showed not my feeling\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"the reaction from the terrible excitement.Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told me to.

I looked around for his\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"one with him. He was quite alone, and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the description to be a phonograph.

We must, therefore, guard\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"and no remorse. He dared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete. In some faculties of mind\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"of me, Professor,\\u201d I said, \\u201cI can\\u2019t see anything to laugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle than before.

Said he not\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"spells of oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water.

When I went into the room, I told the man that a lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: \\u201cWhy?\\u201d\\u201cShe is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it,\\u201d I answered. \\u201cOh, very well,\\u201d he said; \\u201clet her come in,\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"his place far off and silent with respect.

She did not flinch from the pain which I knew\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"some plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a round wooden stake, some two and a half or\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"another of us.\\u201cOf course!\\u201d answered the Professor quickly, \\u201cyou must remain to take care of your so sweet wife!\\u201d Harker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow voice:\\u2014\\u201cLet us talk of that part of it in the morning.

They surrounded it in a cluster, and\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red\\u2014like His, only smaller.

The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead, and his breath came in broken gasps.

I know well what she will say. And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go back home and think. You must\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"If I only knew where to write to or where to go to, I should feel easier; but no one has heard a word of Jonathan since that last letter.

Last night\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"not yet catch him and destroy him, drive him to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be, in time, sure.\\u201d Here I started up for I could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so preciously laden with Mina\\u2019s life and\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"only about 24 hours\\u2019 sail from the Dardanelles to here, at the rate the Czarina Catherine has come from London. She should therefore arrive some time in the morning; but as she cannot possibly get in before then, we are all about to retire early. We shall get up at\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"some terrible restraint on himself. When it was all over, we were standing beside Arthur, who, poor fellow, was speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy\\u2019s veins; I could see Van Helsing\\u2019s face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"a while asked me to take him to Renfield. I did so. As we came to the door we heard the lunatic within singing gaily, as he used to do in the time which now seems so long ago. When we entered we saw with amazement that he had spread\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"me all at once, and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for.\\u201dI comforted him as well as I could. In such cases men do not need much expression. A grip of the hand, the tightening of an arm over the shoulder, a sob in unison,\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"wild garlic from the box waiting in the hall, but which had not been opened, and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed. Then he took from his neck, inside his collar, a little gold crucifix, and placed it over the mouth. He restored the sheet\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"but what will you give to me?\\u201d She looked again questioningly, but this time avoided her husband\\u2019s face. Quincey seemed to understand; he nodded, and her face lit up. \\u201cThen I shall tell you plainly what I want, for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection between us\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"received Mr. Billington\\u2019s courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the Count\\u2019s to its place\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"of the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things began to whirl through my\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"the focus of the searchlight.It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above. Thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"the letters was directed to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna; the third was to Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth, bankers, Buda-Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. I was just about to look at them\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"common sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his mind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be some rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible that the Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone. I\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"flogging the horses, and galloping as hard as they can.\\u201d He paused and went on in a hollow voice:\\u2014\\u201cThey are racing for the sunset. We may be too late.

It soon\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"and studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"on my wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For a second or two she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat; then she fell over\\u2014as if struck with lightning, and her head hit my forehead and\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy\\u2019s coffin we all looked\\u2014Arthur trembling like\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"listening at the same time. And there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from writing. I am unhappy about Lucy and about Jonathan. I had not heard from Jonathan for some time, and was very concerned; but yesterday dear Mr. Hawkins, who is always so\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"will not let it away for some days?\\u201d\\u201cCertainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not healed.\\u201dOur visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"water. One of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to be right before us:\\u2014\\u201cLook! Isten szek!\\u201d\\u2014\\u201cGod\\u2019s seat!\\u201d\\u2014and he crossed himself reverently.As we wound\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"others in the old chapel. It was evident to us that the Count was not at present in the house, and we proceeded to search for any of his effects.After a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms, from basement to attic, we came to the conclusion that the\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"see his idea; but, as I did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As he answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different tone:\\u2014\\u201cOh, it was the grim irony of it all\\u2014this so lovely lady garlanded with flowers, that looked\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"were barking. I wouldn\\u2019t ask him to come in at first, though I knew he wanted to\\u2014just as he had wanted all along. Then he began promising me things\\u2014not in words but by doing them.\\u201d He was interrupted by a word from the Professor:\\u2014\\u201cHow?\\u201d\\u201cBy making them happen; just as he\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"not cheering to me, for amongst them were \\u201cOrdog\\u201d\\u2014Satan, \\u201cpokol\\u201d\\u2014hell, \\u201cstregoica\\u201d\\u2014witch, \\u201cvrolok\\u201d and \\u201cvlkoslak\\u201d\\u2014both of which mean the same thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is either were-wolf or vampire. (Mem., I must ask the Count about these superstitions)When we started, the crowd round the\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"they touched the metal, he made assurance of Lucy\\u2019s coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took out a turnscrew.\\u201cWhat are you going to do?\\u201d I asked.\\u201cTo open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced.\\u201d Straightway he began taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"I was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised, for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up his hands, wringing\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"for ever.Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur\\u2019s shoulder, and said to him:\\u2014\\u201cAnd now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?\\u201dThe reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man\\u2019s hand in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:\\u2014\\u201cForgiven!\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"of the coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to look.I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth, as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness. Van Helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger, but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit stood to him, and he put it down\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"there was a royal lot of it, too\\u2014to keep him from breaking down. I paused before answering, for I felt that I must not betray anything which the Professor wished kept secret; but already he knew so much, and guessed so much, that there could be no reason for not\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"that I wondered we had not noticed before\\u2014came a group of mounted men hurrying along.

Outlined against the snow as they\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"and lie by, and signal for help.... It is nearly all over now. Just as I was beginning to hope that the mate would come out calmer\\u2014for I heard him knocking away at something in the hold, and work is good for him\\u2014there came up the hatchway a sudden, startled\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passing\\u2014like the gladness and sorrow of a man\\u2019s life; how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay;\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"so engage with him when he is at his most weak.\\u201cAnd now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well. You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, you no more must question. We shall tell you all in\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"rebuff of yesterday I have a sort of empty feeling; nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth the doing.... As I knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was work, I went down amongst the patients. I picked out one who has afforded\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"remorseless wars. I drew a great couch out of its place near the corner, so that as I lay, I could look at the lovely view to east and south, and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust, composed myself for sleep. I suppose I must have fallen asleep; I\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"towards me, to keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can\\u2019t abide garlic. Ever since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have escaped their\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"with the sweet Miss Lucy, what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived through centuries, and who had been strengthened by the passing of the years; who would, if they could, have fought for their foul lives....Oh, my friend John, but it was butcher work; had\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"is a wonderfully interesting study.

Can it be\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.

Pardon me, I see that you are in earnest.\\u201d He sat down again, but I could see that he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"August.\\u2014My expectations were wrong, for twice during the night I was wakened by Lucy trying to get out. She seemed, even in her sleep, to be a little impatient at finding the door shut, and went back to bed under a sort of protest. I woke with the dawn, and\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"poor dear Madam Mina. All we can do just now is done; and we can there, at least, protect her. But we need not despair.

He said:\\u2014\\u201cI would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker,\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"not enter. Now let me guard yourself. On your forehead I touch this piece of Sacred Wafer in the name of the Father, the Son, and\\u2014\\u2014\\u201dThere was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear. As he had placed the Wafer on Mina\\u2019s forehead, it had seared it\\u2014had\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"as there was no one in the room it could have been only one.

I explained all these things to\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"time; till at the last, I feel myself to suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may not wake her though I try.

Your pardon, my friend, that unknowingly I did break the seal. Will you not cover it again?\\u201d He held out the letter to me, and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope. I could only redirect it and\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"to do you will know, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a time\\u2014I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may be\\u2014you shall not blame yourselves for\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"beauty that I shudder as though I have come to do murder. Ah, I doubt not that in old time, when such things were, many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine, found at the last his heart fail him, and then his nerve. So\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"us, till when after it had lifted and we looked out, the deil a thing could we see.

They told me you were down in the spirit, and that you were of a ghastly pale.

How can\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"So, as she was prevented from telling them all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, called out \\u201cCheerio then, everyone\\u201d, turned round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went. \\u201cTonight she gets sacked\\u201d, said Mr. Samsa, but he received\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"with her mouth open, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor\\u2019s back. \\u201cAren\\u2019t you coming any closer, then?\\u201d, she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she calmly put the chair back in the corner. Gregor had almost\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"go then\\u201d, he said, and looked up at Mr. Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision. Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times. At that, and without delay, the man\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"him?\\u201d, and Gregor would think to himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every day of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand everything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was still just a child after all,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family.

Now he let himself\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to clean Gregor\\u2019s room again; while his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists; and Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"times a year when they went for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always labour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking slowly for his sake; who would place\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"they\\u2019re eating.

The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the middle had\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet. \\u201cMother, mother\\u201d, said\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of that there\\u2019s the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them.

But this short conversation made the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"than he should. And you\\u2019re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it\\u2019s almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don\\u2019t usually\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud \\u201cOh!\\u201d, which sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him\\u2014he was the nearest to the door\\u2014his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"she attributed all possible understanding to him. She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway. When she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too. Then, without his willing it, his head sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils. When the cleaner came in early in the morning\\u2014they\\u2019d often asked her not to keep slamming the doors but with her\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had declared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor\\u2019s use, and placed it\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street\\u2014which was a hospital\\u2014could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its fa\\u00e7ade; the rain was still falling, now throwing\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"had been dozing\\u2014and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin. With a kind of stubbornness, Gregor\\u2019s father refused to take his uniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg Gregor\\u2019s father would slumber where he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"decisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she did notice him under the couch\\u2014he had to be somewhere, for God\\u2019s\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor\\u2019s use, and placed it beside them.

The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his business trips, who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings; who was hardly even able to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"bucketfuls of water to do it\\u2014although that much dampness also made Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But his mother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"and with a tremor in her voice: \\u201cCome on, let\\u2019s go back in the living room for a while?\\u201d Gregor could see what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down from the wall. Well, she could certainly try it! He\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"anything like they\\u2019re eating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!\\u201d Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the violin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Gregor\\u2019s father to a halt. \\u201cI declare here and now\\u201d,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"a little further forward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came. Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; she was looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turned round; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"did the pain in his tender left side make it difficult to eat the food\\u2014he was only able to eat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole\\u2014but the milk did not taste at all nice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister had\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor\\u2019s responsibility and he could rest. If, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried he really could\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides; he was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to do several times a day. And despite this condition, he was not too\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"now!\\u201d And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway. When she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"nailed to the spot and spread himself out, all his senses in confusion. The last thing he saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his sister had taken off some of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"he called out: \\u201cCome here, then. Let\\u2019s forget about all that old stuff, shall we. Come and give me a bit of attention\\u201d.

As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor\\u2019s use, and placed it beside them. Then, out of consideration for Gregor\\u2019s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her, she hurried\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood\\u2014cleaning up Gregor\\u2019s room was for her and her alone. Gregor\\u2019s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do it\\u2014although that much dampness also made Gregor ill and he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive. So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first, carefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"not stubborn and I like to do my job; being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn\\u2019t earn my living.

This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one or two years, no more. That\\u2019s to say, it was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies; money\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful. As soon as it struck ten, Gregor\\u2019s mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn\\u2019t sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"never once yet been ill. His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the doctor\\u2019s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"persuade him; she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was not there, Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"contrast with the family, they withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume, and they stayed by the window while Gregor\\u2019s father observed them anxiously. It really now seemed very obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"small hotel room. All of them were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, his father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"you want then?\\u201d, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most respect for. \\u201cYes\\u201d, she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, \\u201cwell then, that thing in there, you needn\\u2019t worry about how you\\u2019re going to get rid of it. That\\u2019s\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight o\\u2019clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table\\u2014Samsa was a travelling salesman\\u2014and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters. After that, the three of them left the flat together, which was something they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the open country outside the town. They\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of different newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his body.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"being played, and they must have disturbed Gregor\\u2019s sister, but soon, in contrast with the family, they withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume, and they stayed by the window while Gregor\\u2019s father observed them anxiously. It really now seemed\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the job himself. And without considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state, or that his speech still might not\\u2014or probably would not\\u2014be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through the opening; tried to reach the chief\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage. His sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the idea, not without reason, that she was Gregor\\u2019s spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way. And he could not knock himself out\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"by one of the gentlemen and sat\\u2014leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it\\u2014out of the way in a corner. His sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one on each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing, Gregor\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances, they could not\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"morning and look briefly in on him. At first she would call to him as she did so with words that she probably considered friendly, such as \\u201ccome on then, you old dung-beetle!\\u201d, or \\u201clook at the old dung-beetle there!\\u201d Gregor never responded to being spoken to in that way,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"herself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and answer it. His father had arrived home. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s happened?\\u201d were his first words; Grete\\u2019s appearance must have made everything clear to him. She answered him with subdued voice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: \\u201cMother\\u2019s fainted,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"up; but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"was still there, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite her. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course, but he had to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of the customers, but they just did not have the strength to do any more. And the injury in Gregor\\u2019s back began to hurt as much as when it was new. After they had come back from taking his father to bed Gregor\\u2019s mother and sister would now leave their\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his father, as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible. So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he came in from the hall, could see straight away that\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"against each other. Someone must have heard them in the kitchen, as Gregor\\u2019s father called out: \\u201cIs the playing perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away.\\u201d \\u201cOn the contrary\\u201d, said the middle gentleman, \\u201cwould the young lady not like to come in and play for us\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"leaned over the landing they saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps. As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa family lost interest in\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements\\u2014although he did not really distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"many things had become superfluous which, although they could not be sold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found their way into Gregor\\u2019s room. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way in there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she couldn\\u2019t\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"not seen it until then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make them look away. \\u201cGrete, come with us in here for a little while\\u201d, said Mrs. Samsa with a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards. Then, once they were alone, they ate in near perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then, however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"life. For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he had been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing other than a slight feeling of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"slowly. Gregor remained all this time on the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever he did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five years earlier. Gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted. What he heard his father say was some of the first good news that\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"room that they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest gentlemen\\u2014all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"would Gregor have missed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he\\u2019s been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in the kitchen and just\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"He had suffered it there for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to remind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy. On the contrary, as a family there was\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"we\\u2019ve given up all hope of improvement and we\\u2019re abandoning him to cope for himself? I think it\\u2019d be best to leave the room exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again he\\u2019ll find everything unchanged and he\\u2019ll be able to forget the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"away on some errand. Gregor\\u2019s father and mother certainly did not want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than they could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what distress\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"it\\u2019s nothing serious. But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.\\u201d \\u201cCan the chief clerk come in to see you now then?\\u201d, asked\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"saw screamed: \\u201cOh God, oh God!\\u201d Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. \\u201cGregor!\\u201d shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of transferring Gregor to the new address. He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with a few air holes in it;\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth\\u2014how was he, then, to grasp the key?\\u2014but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up for with a very strong\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who had taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to help him. Two strong people\\u2014he had his father and the maid in mind\\u2014would have been more than enough; they would only have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and careful\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about, he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"cheek; his mother would point to Gregor\\u2019s room and say \\u201cClose that door, Grete\\u201d, and then, when he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table. Gregor hardly slept at\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his head in front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so that\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"they struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was possible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"Gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful. As soon as it struck ten, Gregor\\u2019s mother would speak gently to his father\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"tell him about this reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It was so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody in the flat. \\u201cWhat a quiet life it is the family lead\\u201d, said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: \\u201cGregor! Gregor!\\u201d At the other side door his sister came plaintively: \\u201cGregor? Aren\\u2019t you well? Do you need anything?\\u201d Gregor answered to both sides: \\u201cI\\u2019m ready, now\\u201d, making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"enough and that his father took it to mean that something bad had happened, that he was responsible for some act of violence. That meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"I don\\u2019t think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s absolutely right\\u201d, said Gregor\\u2019s father to himself. His mother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of his head were rearranging themselves into new positions. \\u201cAlright, we\\u2019ll go then\\u201d, he said, and looked up at Mr. Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision. Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"door on the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for Gregor\\u2019s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would stretch\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price;\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"help, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder. Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor\\u2019s mother had pulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture he had inherited? That would have let him crawl around unimpeded in any direction, but it\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"clerk too; you had to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this question, the chief clerk\\u2019s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right, Gregor\\u2019s sister whispered to him to let\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"on the other hand, he didn\\u2019t like at all, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he couldn\\u2019t stand the smell. Long after he had finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turned the key\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. \\u201cHow about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense\\u201d, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"everyone about it last Christmas\\u2014had Christmas really come and gone already?\\u2014if this misfortune hadn\\u2019t got in the way, and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether. He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. \\u201cI\\u2019d like to eat something\\u201d,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"room. On the way they opened the door to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this. \\u201cDead?\\u201d, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"there on the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: \\u201cHelp, for pity\\u2019s sake, Help!\\u201d The way she held her head suggested she\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what\\u2019s more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual. He\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"was not used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In his startlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a little. It was enough to attract his\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"never be realised. Their parents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day. That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of all, more practical. All the time, Grete was becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"and regret. He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or he might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill and, propped up in the chair,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"in his condition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening. He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his room\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the family lead\\u201d, said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and parents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldn\\u2019t get out of bed if he didn\\u2019t spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door one day\\u2014were painfully insistent on things\\u2019 being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor\\u2019s sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"had an adult\\u2019s appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on. Gregor\\u2019s wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what\\u2019s more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest gentlemen\\u2014all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door one day\\u2014were painfully insistent on things\\u2019 being tidy.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"would be heard next door and they would all go silent. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that he\\u2019s doing now\\u201d, his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again. When explaining things, his father repeated himself several\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"practical. All the time, Grete was becoming livelier. With all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor\\u2019s body another shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor. Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete it. \\u201cNow then\\u201d, said Mr. Samsa, \\u201clet\\u2019s give thanks to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"still staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most horrible. In itself, his sister\\u2019s not coming into the room would have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been difficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still there, but not\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"made him confused\\u2014he could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture he had inherited? That would have let him\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"this. \\u201cDead?\\u201d, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it even without checking. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what I said\\u201d, replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor\\u2019s body another shove with the broom, sending it sideways across\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"their well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room. Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"him; now, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the door shut with her foot. So now Gregor was shut out from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"more reasons than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from their decision to move was much more to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"him directly since his transformation. She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too\\u2014he could save his picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"father some more definite ideas. He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile. \\u201cWe have to try and get rid of it\\u201d, said Gregor\\u2019s sister, now speaking only\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high. Gregor\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"for help though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought. After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"than the boss himself\\u2014it\\u2019s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And you\\u2019re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"I\\u2019ll do. That\\u2019s when I\\u2019ll make the big change. First of all though, I\\u2019ve got to get up, my train leaves at five.\\u201d And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. \\u201cGod in Heaven!\\u201d he thought. It was half past six and the hands\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she did notice him under the couch\\u2014he had to be somewhere, for God\\u2019s sake, he couldn\\u2019t have flown away\\u2014she was so shocked that she lost control\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it. His back seemed to be quite hard, and probably\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"There was a cautious knock at the door near his head. \\u201cGregor\\u201d, somebody called\\u2014it was his mother\\u2014\\u201cit\\u2019s quarter to seven. Didn\\u2019t you want to go somewhere?\\u201d That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"be extremely strict with him. And so he ran up to his father, stopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, even slightly. In this way they went round the room several times without anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression of a chase as everything\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"already walking slowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully and, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his companions around him. He was standing up straight enough now; dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"not even his sister, thought that he could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister\\u2019s sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was only later, when she had become a little more used to everything\\u2014there was, of course, no\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy eyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp. He took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in an arc right across the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"a little while\\u201d, said Mrs. Samsa with a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"As it is this animal is persecuting us, it\\u2019s driven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on the streets. Father, look, just look\\u201d, she suddenly screamed, \\u201che\\u2019s starting again!\\u201d In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor\\u2019s comprehension, his\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to remove the apple lodged in Gregor\\u2019s flesh, so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it there for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to remind even his father that Gregor, despite his current sad and revolting form, was\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor\\u2019s room to his sister; from her left, Gregor\\u2019s sister screamed at her that she was never to clean Gregor\\u2019s room again; while his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss\\u2019s anger\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"rage about the lack of attention he was shown, and although he could think of nothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he could get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to, even if he was not hungry. Gregor\\u2019s sister\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the wall. Perhaps only because her mother was there, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice: \\u201cCome on, let\\u2019s go back in the living room for a while?\\u201d Gregor could see\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"ate very much. Gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive no more answer than \\u201cno thanks, I\\u2019ve had enough\\u201d or something similar. No-one drank very much either. His sister would sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up. Gregor\\u2019s mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Gregor\\u2019s sister would leave her work\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"throw everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved it because, with no other room free where he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"him totally\\u2014now Gregor lost his ability to see anything\\u2014her hands behind his father\\u2019s head begging him to spare Gregor\\u2019s life. No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor\\u2019s flesh, so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it there for more than a\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to use several bucketfuls of water to do it\\u2014although that much dampness also made Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile. But his mother was to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly had his sister arrived home in the evening\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The household budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed; an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was looked after by Gregor\\u2019s mother on\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"my boss; I\\u2019d get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn\\u2019t have my parents to think about I\\u2019d have given in my notice a long time ago, I\\u2019d have gone up to the boss and told him\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"had his head in front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them; to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed. There was a loud thump, but it wasn\\u2019t really a loud noise. His fall was softened a\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table. He lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was quiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for Gregor to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"clapping his hands, \\u201cget a locksmith here, now!\\u201d And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"there, and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"was happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all, but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all these things made him feel as if he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"that could be construed as friendly. \\u201cHe\\u2019s enjoyed his dinner today\\u201d, she might say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became more and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, \\u201cnow everything\\u2019s just been left\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the last time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all around the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became more and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, \\u201cnow everything\\u2019s just been left there again\\u201d. Although Gregor wasn\\u2019t able to hear any news directly he did listen\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"she tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway. When she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"when he simply became too tired to continue listening, when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up again with a start, as even the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go silent. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that he\\u2019s doing\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"that his father, when he came in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would go back into his room without delay, that it would not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the door and he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer than they were, Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat. They decided the best way to make use of that day\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come. \\u201cYou can come in,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"on the floor. So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not knowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall\\u2014which was already denuded of everything\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"sheet where it was. Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked the new arrangement. For the first fourteen days, Gregor\\u2019s parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. \\u201cThat\\u2019ll be someone from work\\u201d,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"catch her breath, began to cough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes. Gregor\\u2019s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead. Her words seemed to give Gregor\\u2019s father some more definite ideas. He sat upright, played\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"Meanwhile, it had become very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed against the door and listening. Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once there he let\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"out in her nightdress; and that is how they went into Gregor\\u2019s room. On the way they opened the door to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"and there\\u2019s still a fog like this.\\u201d And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state. But then he said to himself: \\u201cBefore it strikes quarter past seven I\\u2019ll definitely have\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much better. It had even become very\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He\\u2019d fall right off his desk! And it\\u2019s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what\\u2019s more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"desk with its place clearly worn into the floor, the desk where he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at infant school\\u2014he really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women\\u2019s intentions were good. He had nearly\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"time\\u201d, he thought, \\u201cit makes you stupid. You\\u2019ve got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury.

It really now seemed very obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that they had had enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window. Would his sister have to go and earn money? She was still a child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to get to work. But since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"came in, not every day of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand everything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was still just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult\\u2019s appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"help her. As she approached the room, Gregor could hear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent. First, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright; and only then did she let her mother\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"chief clerk called \\u201cGood morning, Mr. Samsa\\u201d. \\u201cHe isn\\u2019t well\\u201d, said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through the door. \\u201cHe isn\\u2019t well, please believe me. Why else would Gregor have missed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet. \\u201cSomething\\u2019s fallen down in there\\u201d, said the chief clerk\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all directions. \\u201cWhat is it you want then?\\u201d, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most respect for. \\u201cYes\\u201d, she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made her\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold, which\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn\\u2019t know what to make\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"most respect for. \\u201cYes\\u201d, she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, \\u201cwell then, that thing in there, you needn\\u2019t worry about how you\\u2019re going to get rid of it. That\\u2019s all been sorted out.\\u201d Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"individual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: \\u201cGregor, open the door, I beg of you.\\u201d Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"was something that had to be risked. When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed\\u2014the new method was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and forth\\u2014it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"bit of attention\\u201d. The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters. After that, the three of them left the flat together, which was something they had not done for months, and took\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"since he had first been incarcerated in his room. He had thought that nothing at all remained from his father\\u2019s business, at least he had never told him anything different, and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway. Their business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"You\\u2019ve got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.

Gregor then\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on. If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"turned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they came back. They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon; Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her. \\u201cWhat shall\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"from hunger, made it impossible for him to move. He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he waited. He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on his mother\\u2019s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn\\u2019t get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"His mother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes. Gregor\\u2019s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead. Her words seemed to give Gregor\\u2019s\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room. Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr. Samsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other. All of them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"is this animal is persecuting us, it\\u2019s driven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on the streets.

The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the others,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was looked after by Gregor\\u2019s mother on top of the large amount of sewing work she did. Gregor even learned, listening to the evening conversation about what price they had hoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"had got into the habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest gentlemen\\u2014all three of them had full beards,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table. Gregor hardly slept at all, either night or day. Sometimes he would think of taking over the family\\u2019s affairs, just like before, the next time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"only been alarmed briefly. Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence. His mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his father with her arms around his neck. \\u201cMaybe now\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"space to get through. He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway. What he did, making more noise\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"off a piece of meat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor\\u2019s mother and sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"pleasure, would just raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they went for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always labour his way forward a little more slowly than\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"improvement and we\\u2019re abandoning him to cope for himself? I think it\\u2019d be best to leave the room exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again he\\u2019ll find everything unchanged and he\\u2019ll be able to forget the time in between all the easier\\u201d.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"about with longing when he was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. All of them were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, his father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet; his\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"family had been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was no imaginable way\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening. There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening, when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"a lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated. Besides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had been bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention.

The food came out again just the same as when it went in\\u201d.

Gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"used to the idea, not without reason, that she was Gregor\\u2019s spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him. This meant that his mother\\u2019s advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had thought\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"I didn\\u2019t let you know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home. Please, don\\u2019t make my parents suffer! There\\u2019s no basis for any of the accusations you\\u2019re making; nobody\\u2019s ever said a word to me about any of these things. Maybe\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"again and smiled. The family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor\\u2019s father came into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out. She had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched himself. This was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning while\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"all the things he was entitled to, even if he was not hungry. Gregor\\u2019s sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at midday,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully. \\u201cThis is something that can\\u2019t be done in bed\\u201d,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"now. I\\u2019m quite fresh again now, though. I\\u2019m just getting out of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It\\u2019s not quite as easy as I\\u2019d thought. I\\u2019m quite alright now, though. It\\u2019s shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents know about\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor\\u2019s sign that he could break his\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who had taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be able\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the monotonous life led by the family during these two months, must have made him confused\\u2014he could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptied out. Had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his present state, or that his speech still might not\\u2014or probably would not\\u2014be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who, ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but Gregor fell immediately over\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn\\u2019t sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he had become\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"and that made him feel better. He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements\\u2014although he did not really distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"herself and could have known it even without checking. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what I said\\u201d, replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor\\u2019s body another shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor. Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"them. For this reason, many things had become superfluous which, although they could not be sold, the family did not wish to discard. All these things found their way into Gregor\\u2019s room. The dustbins from the kitchen found their way in there too. The charwoman was always in a hurry,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet. \\u201cMother, mother\\u201d, said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had completely forgotten the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"and pressed her hands to her face. A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor\\u2019s father as he drove him back, making\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on. If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret. For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they should do now; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject as there were always at least two members of the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its fa\\u00e7ade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from breakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for Gregor\\u2019s father, breakfast\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"dark. He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae\\u2014of which he was now beginning to learn the value\\u2014in order to see what had been happening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar, and he limped badly on his\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it\\u2019s not the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that; but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to be.\\u201d \\u201cBut Sir\\u201d, called Gregor,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"disappeared and would reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher\\u2019s boy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer than they were, Mr. Samsa\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come into Gregor\\u2019s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood\\u2014cleaning up Gregor\\u2019s room was for her and her alone.

Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was his father\\u2019s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"having a lazy son, and accept the doctor\\u2019s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what\\u2019s more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"nothing for him to do but wait; and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about, he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table. He\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"For the days that I have been living here I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"They must have noticed it.

It is true that his entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether.

On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his father and the maid in mind\\u2014would have been more than enough; they would only have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o\\u2019clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor\\u2019s not being there a long time ago.

The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only then would he consider what to do next, as he was well\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of March, after all. The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. \\u201cWhere is our breakfast?\\u201d, the middle gentleman\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"were both angry and glad at the same time. Gregor drew his head back from the door and lifted it towards his father. He really had not imagined his father the way he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about, he had neglected to pay\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the chance to go and fetch it herself. When his father then said nothing she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send the housekeeper for it, but then his father would close\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.\\u201d \\u201cCan the chief clerk come in to see you now then?\\u201d, asked his father impatiently, knocking at the door again. \\u201cNo\\u201d, said Gregor. In the room on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"bit of him that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to spare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"they all should have been calling to him, his father and his mother too: \\u201cWell done, Gregor\\u201d, they should have cried, \\u201ckeep at it, keep hold of the lock!\\u201d And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"your own business at home, and on top of that there\\u2019s the curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them.

The family themselves ate in the kitchen. Nonetheless, Gregor\\u2019s father came into the living room before he went into the kitchen, bowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table. The gentlemen stood as one,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"painfully close to his scalp. He took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and, with look of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"parents\\u2019 debt to him\\u2014another five or six years I suppose\\u2014that\\u2019s definitely what I\\u2019ll do.

That needn\\u2019t surprise you.\\u201d My voice trembled so that I felt it impossible to suppress the shake. \\u201cDon\\u2019t you remember how I told\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"about the place, have walked three miles; but I was to be, later on, so much more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill. The most singular part of it, in fact\\u2014singular as the rest had been\\u2014was the part I became, in the hall, aware\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"does that, miss!\\u201d I couldn\\u2019t have desired more emphasis, but I just hesitated. \\u201cShe\\u2019s so horrible?\\u201d I saw my colleague scarce knew how to put it. \\u201cReally shocking.\\u201d \\u201cAnd about me?\\u201d \\u201cAbout you, miss\\u2014since you must have it. It\\u2019s beyond everything, for a young lady; and I can\\u2019t think wherever\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"be with me. Before a new day, in my room, had fully broken, my eyes opened to Mrs. Grose, who had come to my bedside with worse news. Flora was so markedly feverish that an illness was perhaps at hand; she had passed a night of extreme unrest, a night\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"wickedly?\\u201d \\u201cDear me, no\\u2014I could have borne that. She gave me never a glance. She only fixed the child.\\u201d Mrs. Grose tried to see it. \\u201cFixed her?\\u201d \\u201cAh, with such awful eyes!\\u201d She stared at mine as if they might really have resembled them. \\u201cDo you mean of dislike?\\u201d \\u201cGod\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"have them all to this hour. This was a rule indeed which only added to the satiric effect of my being plied with the supposition that he might at any moment be among us. It was exactly as if my charges knew how almost more awkward than anything else that\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"fear for them?\\u201d We met in another long look. \\u201cDon\\u2019t you?\\u201d Instead of answering she came nearer to the window and, for a minute, applied her face to the glass. \\u201cYou see how he could see,\\u201d I meanwhile went on. She didn\\u2019t move. \\u201cHow long was he here?\\u201d \\u201cTill I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"in the interval, certainly had held me and driven me, for I must, in circling about the place, have walked three miles; but I was to be, later on, so much more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill. The most singular part of it,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"eagerness, \\u201cyou wanted me to tell you something.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s it. Out, straight out. What you have on your mind, you know.\\u201d \\u201cAh, then, is that what you\\u2019ve stayed over for?\\u201d He spoke with a gaiety through which I could still catch the finest little quiver of resentful passion; but I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"spirit, \\u201cyou may be sure it will be to take you quite away.\\u201d \\u201cWell, don\\u2019t you understand that that\\u2019s exactly what I\\u2019m working for? You\\u2019ll have to tell him\\u2014about the way you\\u2019ve let it all drop: you\\u2019ll have to tell him a tremendous lot!\\u201d The exultation with which he uttered\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"she had no direct communication with the sources of my trouble. If they had been at all visibly blighted or battered, she would doubtless have grown, on tracing it back, haggard enough to match them; as matters stood, however, I could feel her, when she surveyed them, with her large\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"laugh. \\u201cAre you afraid he\\u2019ll corrupt you?\\u201d She put the question with such a fine bold humor that, with a laugh, a little silly doubtless, to match her own, I gave way for the time to the apprehension of ridicule. But the next day, as the hour for my drive\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"a laugh that was doubtless significant enough. It only, in truth, left my friend still more grave. \\u201cWell, perhaps I ought to also\\u2014since I\\u2019ve heard some of it before! Yet I can\\u2019t bear it,\\u201d the poor woman went on while, with the same movement, she glanced, on my dressing table,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"of affairs that led them sometimes without the least pertinence to break out into sociable reminders. I was invited\\u2014with no visible connection\\u2014to repeat afresh Goody Gosling\\u2019s celebrated mot or to confirm the details already supplied as to the cleverness of the vicarage pony. It was partly at such junctures as\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"of a creature scared, or rather wounded, which, in turn, within a few seconds, was completed by a gasp of my own. I seized my colleague\\u2019s arm. \\u201cShe\\u2019s there, she\\u2019s there!\\u201d Miss Jessel stood before us on the opposite bank exactly as she had stood the other time, and I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"doing. This came out when, at the schoolroom door, she quitted me. \\u201cSurely you don\\u2019t accuse him\\u2014\\u201d \\u201cOf carrying on an intercourse that he conceals from me? Ah, remember that, until further evidence, I now accuse nobody.\\u201d Then, before shutting her out to go, by another passage, to her own\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with suspicion, might of course have made me uneasy. But it was a comfort that there could be no uneasiness in a connection with anything so beatific as the radiant image of my little girl, the vision of whose angelic\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"In the first weeks the days were long; they often, at their finest, gave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my pupils, teatime and bedtime having come and gone, I had, before my final retirement, a small interval alone. Much as I liked\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"music, she engaged.\\u201d And Douglas, with this, made a pause that, for the benefit of the company, moved me to throw in\\u2014 \\u201cThe moral of which was of course the seduction exercised by the splendid young man. She succumbed to it.\\u201d He got up and, as he had done the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"be held with the flame of the candle full in the wonderful little face that was still flushed with sleep. I remember closing my eyes an instant, yieldingly, consciously, as before the excess of something beautiful that shone out of the blue of her own. \\u201cYou were looking for me\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"into the depths of blue of the child\\u2019s eyes and pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which I naturally preferred to abjure my judgment and, so far as might be, my agitation. I couldn\\u2019t abjure for merely wanting\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"a fiend, at any rate, I shouldn\\u2019t take him in.\\u201d My companion, after an instant and for all answer, sat down again and grasped my arm. \\u201cMake him at any rate come to you.\\u201d I stared. \\u201cTo me?\\u201d I had a sudden fear of what she might do. \\u201c\\u2018Him\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cHe\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"own. \\u201cShe persists in denying to you that she saw, or has ever seen, anything?\\u201d My visitor\\u2019s trouble, truly, was great. \\u201cAh, miss, it isn\\u2019t a matter on which I can push her! Yet it isn\\u2019t either, I must say, as if I much needed to. It has made her,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"saying; \\u201cno, let us put it definitely, my dear, that I don\\u2019t. But if I did, you know, there\\u2019s a thing I should require now, just without sparing you the least bit more\\u2014oh, not a scrap, come!\\u2014to get out of you. What was it you had in mind when, in\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the dining room was on the ground floor, not going down to the terrace on which he stood. His face was close to the glass, yet the effect of this better view was, strangely, only to show me how intense the former had been. He remained but a few seconds\\u2014long\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"\\u201cThem\\u2014that creature?\\u201d I had to smother a kind of howl. \\u201cAnd you could bear it!\\u201d \\u201cNo. I couldn\\u2019t\\u2014and I can\\u2019t now!\\u201d And the poor woman burst into tears. A rigid control, from the next day, was, as I have said, to follow them; yet how often and how passionately, for\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"magnificent had there been anyone to admire it, I laid down my book, rose to my feet, and, taking a candle, went straight out of the room and, from the passage, on which my light made little impression, noiselessly closed and locked the door. I can say now neither what\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"straight out of the door again, reached that of the house, got, in an instant, upon the drive, and, passing along the terrace as fast as I could rush, turned a corner and came full in sight. But it was in sight of nothing now\\u2014my visitor had vanished. I stopped,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"arts I could contrive, to win the child into the sense of knowing me. I spent the day with her out-of-doors; I arranged with her, to her great satisfaction, that it should be she, she only, who might show me the place. She showed it step by step and room\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I gave myself up to it; it was an antidote to any pain, and I had more pains than one. I was in receipt in these days of disturbing letters from home, where things were not going well. But with my children, what things in the world mattered? That was\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"was not with what I kept back. I put out my hand to her and she took it; I held her hard a little, liking to feel her close to me. There was a kind of support in the shy heave of her surprise. \\u201cYou came for me for church,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"at all interlocutors, but above all at his eternal governess, he threw off intonations as if he were tossing roses. There was something in them that always made one \\u201ccatch,\\u201d and I caught, at any rate, now so effectually that I stopped as short as if one of the trees\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"of the faint breath of his inward trouble, appear as accessible as an older person\\u2014imposed him almost as an intellectual equal. \\u201cI thought you wanted to go on as you are.\\u201d It struck me that at this he just faintly colored. He gave, at any rate, like a convalescent slightly\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"spot\\u2014and with a shock much greater than any vision had allowed for\\u2014was the sense that my imagination had, in a flash, turned real. He did stand there!\\u2014but high up, beyond the lawn and at the very top of the tower to which, on that first morning, little Flora had conducted\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"with my boy?\\u201d \\u201cToo free with everyone!\\u201d I forbore, for the moment, to analyze this description further than by the reflection that a part of it applied to several of the members of the household, of the half-dozen maids and men who were still of our small colony. But there\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"in the day I liked most; and I liked it best of all when, as the light faded\\u2014or rather, I should say, the day lingered and the last calls of the last birds sounded, in a flushed sky, from the old trees\\u2014I could take a turn into the grounds and\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"my little charges. Why did they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual society? Something or other had brought nearer home to me that I had all but pinned the boy to my shawl and that, in the way our companions were marshaled before me, I might have appeared to provide\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"\\u201cBefore what?\\u201d \\u201cBefore she became too ill to travel.\\u201d I found myself prompt. \\u201cShe\\u2019s not too ill to travel: she only might have become so if she had stayed. This was just the moment to seize. The journey will dissipate the influence\\u201d\\u2014oh, I was grand!\\u2014\\u201cand carry it off.\\u201d \\u201cI see,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"believe, nowhere very great. But what I judge most likely is that she\\u2019s on the spot from which, the other day, we saw together what I told you.\\u201d \\u201cWhen she pretended not to see\\u2014?\\u201d \\u201cWith that astounding self-possession? I\\u2019ve always been sure she wanted to go back alone. And now\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I should have happened at such a moment to be particularly and very gratefully struck with the obedience of my little charges. Why did they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual society? Something or other had brought nearer home to me that I had all but pinned the boy to\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"pretty, miss, even as you.\\u201d \\u201cAh, then, I hope her youth and her beauty helped her!\\u201d I recollect throwing off. \\u201cHe seems to like us young and pretty!\\u201d \\u201cOh, he did,\\u201d Mrs. Grose assented: \\u201cit was the way he liked everyone!\\u201d She had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"of the burden. I knew at this hour, I think, as well as I knew later, what I was capable of meeting to shelter my pupils; but it took me some time to be wholly sure of what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so compromising\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"of the water without a sight of the child. There was no trace of Flora on that nearer side of the bank where my observation of her had been most startling, and none on the opposite edge, where, save for a margin of some twenty yards, a thick copse came\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"of the staircase. At this point I precipitately found myself aware of three things. They were practically simultaneous, yet they had flashes of succession. My candle, under a bold flourish, went out, and I perceived, by the uncovered window, that the yielding dusk of earliest morning rendered it unnecessary. Without\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the dark and after leaving the public house, on the steepish icy slope, a wrong path altogether, at the bottom of which he lay. The icy slope, the turn mistaken at night and in liquor, accounted for much\\u2014practically, in the end and after the inquest and boundless chatter, for everything;\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"down at my old hour. I slept immediately and, as I afterward knew, till about one o\\u2019clock; but when I woke it was to sit straight up, as completely roused as if a hand had shook me. I had left a light burning, but it was now out, and I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"slept at my post. It was after luncheon, and by the schoolroom fire, and yet I hadn\\u2019t really, in the least, slept: I had only done something much worse\\u2014I had forgotten. Where, all this time, was Flora? When I put the question to Miles, he played on a minute before\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"anger for it, of being confined against his will. Once more, as he had done before, he looked up at the dim day as if, of what had hitherto sustained him, nothing was left but an unspeakable anxiety. \\u201cOh, yes,\\u201d he nevertheless replied\\u2014\\u201cthey must have repeated them. To those they\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"can hear you all. But nonetheless, between Miles and me, it\\u2019s now all out.\\u201d \\u201cAll out?\\u201d My companion stared. \\u201cBut what, miss?\\u201d \\u201cEverything. It doesn\\u2019t matter. I\\u2019ve made up my mind. I came home, my dear,\\u201d I went on, \\u201cfor a talk with Miss Jessel.\\u201d I had by this time\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"to put it to him. \\u201cYou must tell me now\\u2014and all the truth. What did you go out for? What were you doing there?\\u201d I can still see his wonderful smile, the whites of his beautiful eyes, and the uncovering of his little teeth shine to me in the dusk.\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"\\u201cIt was the beauty of it. There were others,\\u201d he went on, \\u201cwho hadn\\u2019t succumbed. He told her frankly all his difficulty\\u2014that for several applicants the conditions had been prohibitive. They were, somehow, simply afraid. It sounded dull\\u2014it sounded strange; and all the more so because of his main condition.\\u201d\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"was a matter, for either party, of habit. It was a pity that I should have had to quaver out again the reasons for my not having, in my delusion, so much as questioned that the little girl saw our visitant even as I actually saw Mrs. Grose herself, and\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"on the other hand, that the element of the unnamed and untouched became, between us, greater than any other, and that so much avoidance could not have been so successfully effected without a great deal of tacit arrangement. It was as if, at moments, we were perpetually coming into sight\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"by all the rest?\\u201d \\u201cOh, you know, you know!\\u201d I could say nothing for a minute, though I felt, as I held his hand and our eyes continued to meet, that my silence had all the air of admitting his charge and that nothing in the whole world of reality\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"me\\u2014which struck me indeed as perhaps the best thing to make him. Yet in the very pang of the effort I felt it vain to try sternness, and I heard myself the next instant so gentle as to be almost grotesque. \\u201cYou want so to go out again?\\u201d \\u201cAwfully!\\u201d He\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"see his wonderful smile, the whites of his beautiful eyes, and the uncovering of his little teeth shine to me in the dusk. \\u201cIf I tell you why, will you understand?\\u201d My heart, at this, leaped into my mouth. Would he tell me why? I found no sound on my\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"my own. I learned something\\u2014at first, certainly\\u2014that had not been one of the teachings of my small, smothered life; learned to be amused, and even amusing, and not to think for the morrow. It was the first time, in a manner, that I had known space and air and freedom,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"marvelous knack of catching and repeating. The schoolroom piano broke into all gruesome fancies; and when that failed there were confabulations in corners, with a sequel of one of them going out in the highest spirits in order to \\u201ccome in\\u201d as something new. I had had brothers myself, and\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"holidays, to look after the small boy, who had been for a term at school\\u2014young as he was to be sent, but what else could be done?\\u2014and who, as the holidays were about to begin, would be back from one day to the other. There had been for the two\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"one thing, that was bad.\\u201d \\u201cAnd for another thing?\\u201d I waited. \\u201cHe repeated your words to Quint?\\u201d \\u201cNo, not that. It\\u2019s just what he wouldn\\u2019t!\\u201d she could still impress upon me. \\u201cI was sure, at any rate,\\u201d she added, \\u201cthat he didn\\u2019t. But he denied certain occasions.\\u201d \\u201cWhat occasions?\\u201d \\u201cWhen\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"to asseverate to my friend that I was certain\\u2014which was so much to the good\\u2014that I at least had not betrayed myself. I should not have been prompted, by stress of need, by desperation of mind\\u2014I scarce know what to call it\\u2014to invoke such further aid to intelligence as might\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"in a locked drawer\\u2014it has not been out for years. I could write to my man and enclose the key; he could send down the packet as he finds it.\\u201d It was to me in particular that he appeared to propound this\\u2014appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate.\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the time has certainly come to give me the whole thing.\\u201d She appeared to assent to this, but still only in silence; seeing which I went on: \\u201cI must have it now. Of what did she die? Come, there was something between them.\\u201d \\u201cThere was everything.\\u201d \\u201cIn spite of the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"a lonely place is a permitted object of fear to a young woman privately bred; and the figure that faced me was\\u2014a few more seconds assured me\\u2014as little anyone else I knew as it was the image that had been in my mind. I had not seen it in Harley\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"what had occurred had as yet, for the eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow. To mark, for the house, the high state I cultivated I decreed that my meals with the boy should be served, as we called it, downstairs; so that I had been awaiting him in the ponderous\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"only through the pressure of his anxiety. Yet it did reach him. \\u201cDid I steal?\\u201d I felt myself redden to the roots of my hair as well as wonder if it were more strange to put to a gentleman such a question or to see him take it with allowances\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"She would also have, in holidays, to look after the small boy, who had been for a term at school\\u2014young as he was to be sent, but what else could be done?\\u2014and who, as the holidays were about to begin, would be back from one day to the other. There\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"my room, in a drawer. As soon as I could compass a private word with Mrs. Grose I declared to her that it was grotesque. She promptly understood me. \\u201cYou mean the cruel charge\\u2014?\\u201d \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t live an instant. My dear woman, look at him!\\u201d She smiled at my pretention\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"them\\u2014and it\\u2019s a marvel for a governess: I call the sisterhood to witness!\\u2014I made constant fresh discoveries. There was one direction, assuredly, in which these discoveries stopped: deep obscurity continued to cover the region of the boy\\u2019s conduct at school. It had been promptly given me, I have noted, to\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"heard them, would simply appall us.\\u201d \\u201cAnd if she is there\\u2014\\u201d \\u201cYes?\\u201d \\u201cThen Miss Jessel is?\\u201d \\u201cBeyond a doubt. You shall see.\\u201d \\u201cOh, thank you!\\u201d my friend cried, planted so firm that, taking it in, I went straight on without her. By the time I reached the pool, however, she\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"visitor with whom I had been so inexplicably and yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately concerned. It took little time to see that I could sound without forms of inquiry and without exciting remark any domestic complications. The shock I had suffered must have sharpened all my senses;\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"wide, and his lips are thin, and except for his little whiskers he\\u2019s quite clean-shaven. He gives me a sort of sense of looking like an actor.\\u201d \\u201cAn actor!\\u201d It was impossible to resemble one less, at least, than Mrs. Grose at that moment. \\u201cI\\u2019ve never seen one, but so\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"innocence; so how the deuce would he get out of it? There beat in me indeed, with the passionate throb of this question an equal dumb appeal as to how the deuce I should. I was confronted at last, as never yet, with all the risk attached even now to\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"she had forgiven him than her anecdote struck me as presenting to my own tenderness an occasion for doing. This came out when, at the schoolroom door, she quitted me. \\u201cSurely you don\\u2019t accuse him\\u2014\\u201d \\u201cOf carrying on an intercourse that he conceals from me? Ah, remember that, until further\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"she fixed her eyes on the duskier distance, then, pulling herself together, turned to me with abrupt inconsequence. \\u201cIt\\u2019s time we should be at church.\\u201d \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m not fit for church!\\u201d \\u201cWon\\u2019t it do you good?\\u201d \\u201cIt won\\u2019t do them!\\u2014 I nodded at the house. \\u201cThe children?\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t leave\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the interval, certainly had held me and driven me, for I must, in circling about the place, have walked three miles; but I was to be, later on, so much more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill. The most singular part of it, in\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"mind. \\u201cNothing.\\u201d \\u201cAnd to his uncle?\\u201d I was incisive. \\u201cNothing.\\u201d \\u201cAnd to the boy himself?\\u201d I was wonderful. \\u201cNothing.\\u201d She gave with her apron a great wipe to her mouth. \\u201cThen I\\u2019ll stand by you. We\\u2019ll see it out.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019ll see it out!\\u201d I ardently echoed, giving her my hand\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"that I stopped as short as if one of the trees of the park had fallen across the road. There was something new, on the spot, between us, and he was perfectly aware that I recognized it, though, to enable me to do so, he had no need to look\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"way round?\\u201d \\u201cCertainly, far as it is. It will take us but ten minutes, but it\\u2019s far enough to have made the child prefer not to walk. She went straight over.\\u201d \\u201cLaws!\\u201d cried my friend again; the chain of my logic was ever too much for her. It dragged her\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"silence that, however, I would engage to break down on the first private opportunity. This opportunity came before tea: I secured five minutes with her in the housekeeper\\u2019s room, where, in the twilight, amid a smell of lately baked bread, but with the place all swept and garnished, I found\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"of her surprise. \\u201cYou came for me for church, of course, but I can\\u2019t go.\\u201d \\u201cHas anything happened?\\u201d \\u201cYes. You must know now. Did I look very queer?\\u201d \\u201cThrough this window? Dreadful!\\u201d \\u201cWell,\\u201d I said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve been frightened.\\u201d Mrs. Grose\\u2019s eyes expressed plainly that she had no wish to be,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"of flights and drops, a little seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong. After rising, in town, to meet his appeal, I had at all events a couple of very bad days\\u2014found myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake. In this state of mind I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"bring me up. And all the rest!\\u201d I fairly held my breath a minute, and even from my glimmering taper there was light enough to show how he smiled up at me from his pillow. \\u201cWhat do you mean by all the rest?\\u201d \\u201cOh, you know, you know!\\u201d I could\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"irrelevant, or at any rate as impersonal, as Mrs. Marcet or nine-times-nine. \\u201cOh, but you know,\\u201d she quite adequately answered, \\u201cthat you might come back, you dear, and that you have!\\u201d And after a little, when she had got into bed, I had, for a long time, by almost sitting\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"sarcastically. \\u201cTo his poor little innocent mates!\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s too dreadful,\\u201d cried Mrs. Grose, \\u201cto say such cruel things! Why, he\\u2019s scarce ten years old.\\u201d \\u201cYes, yes; it would be incredible.\\u201d She was evidently grateful for such a profession. \\u201cSee him, miss, first. Then believe it!\\u201d I felt forthwith a new\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"go to the village. Meanwhile there had been, on the part of my pupils, no more brilliant, more exemplary morning. It was exactly as if they had both had at heart to gloss over any recent little friction. They performed the dizziest feats of arithmetic, soaring quite out of my\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"you didn\\u2019t tell me?\\u201d \\u201cNo\\u2014for reasons. But now that you\\u2019ve guessed\\u2014\\u201d Mrs. Grose\\u2019s round eyes encountered this charge. \\u201cAh, I haven\\u2019t guessed!\\u201d she said very simply. \\u201cHow can I if you don\\u2019t imagine?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t in the very least.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019ve seen him nowhere but on the tower?\\u201d \\u201cAnd on this\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"which I had not been prepared and in the presence of which I found myself, freshly, a little scared as well as a little proud. Lessons, in this agitation, certainly suffered some delay; I reflected that my first duty was, by the gentlest arts I could contrive, to win the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"an example of delay. What I said to myself above all was that Miles had got something out of me and that the proof of it, for him, would be just this awkward collapse. He had got out of me that there was something I was much afraid of and\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"a joy in the extraordinary flight of heroism the occasion demanded of me. I now saw that I had been asked for a service admirable and difficult; and there would be a greatness in letting it be seen\\u2014oh, in the right quarter!\\u2014that I could succeed where many another girl might\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"you so sure of the little gentleman?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure of anything but you. But I have, since last evening, a new hope. I think he wants to give me an opening. I do believe that\\u2014poor little exquisite wretch!\\u2014he wants to speak. Last evening, in the firelight and the silence,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"stopped, I almost dropped, with the real relief of this; but I took in the whole scene\\u2014I gave him time to reappear. I call it time, but how long was it? I can\\u2019t speak to the purpose today of the duration of these things. That kind of measure must have\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"things are not for me, miss.\\u201d My counselor couldn\\u2019t read! I winced at my mistake, which I attenuated as I could, and opened my letter again to repeat it to her; then, faltering in the act and folding it up once more, I put it back in my pocket. \\u201cIs\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"edifying\\u2014while I sat with the children at their tea, served on Sundays, by exception, in that cold, clean temple of mahogany and brass, the \\u201cgrown-up\\u201d dining room. The gloves had been dropped there, and I turned in to recover them. The day was gray enough, but the afternoon light still\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"emptiness. There were shrubberies and big trees, but I remember the clear assurance I felt that none of them concealed him. He was there or was not there: not there if I didn\\u2019t see him. I got hold of this; then, instinctively, instead of returning as I had come, went\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"as a great betrayal. I saw him, from the midst of my act, meet it with a divination, and on the perception that even now he only guessed, and that the window was still to his own eyes free, I let the impulse flame up to convert the climax of\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"previous night. It appeared that the narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue. Let me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative, from an exact transcript of my own made much later, is what I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I was shaken. Was there a \\u201csecret\\u201d at Bly\\u2014a mystery of Udolpho or an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected confinement? I can\\u2019t say how long I turned it over, or how long, in a confusion of curiosity and dread, I remained where I had had my collision; I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"for air and light, he was at me in a white rage, bewildered, glaring vainly over the place and missing wholly, though it now, to my sense, filled the room like the taste of poison, the wide, overwhelming presence. \\u201cIt\\u2019s he?\\u201d I was so determined to have all my proof\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"boy himself?\\u201d I was wonderful. \\u201cNothing.\\u201d She gave with her apron a great wipe to her mouth. \\u201cThen I\\u2019ll stand by you. We\\u2019ll see it out.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019ll see it out!\\u201d I ardently echoed, giving her my hand to make it a vow. She held me there a moment, then whisked\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"to carry a bad name with a greater sweetness of innocence, and by the time I had got back to Bly with him I remained merely bewildered\\u2014so far, that is, as I was not outraged\\u2014by the sense of the horrible letter locked up in my room, in a drawer. As\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"promise you I would have told!\\u201d She felt my discrimination. \\u201cI daresay I was wrong. But, really, I was afraid.\\u201d \\u201cAfraid of what?\\u201d \\u201cOf things that man could do. Quint was so clever\\u2014he was so deep.\\u201d I took this in still more than, probably, I showed. \\u201cYou weren\\u2019t afraid of\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"for a little more light. \\u201cWho was it she was in love with?\\u201d \\u201cThe story will tell,\\u201d I took upon myself to reply. \\u201cOh, I can\\u2019t wait for the story!\\u201d \\u201cThe story won\\u2019t tell,\\u201d said Douglas; \\u201cnot in any literal, vulgar way.\\u201d \\u201cMore\\u2019s the pity, then. That\\u2019s the only way\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"let myself go. I threw myself upon him and in the tenderness of my pity I embraced him. \\u201cDear little Miles, dear little Miles\\u2014!\\u201d My face was close to his, and he let me kiss him, simply taking it with indulgent good humor. \\u201cWell, old lady?\\u201d \\u201cIs there nothing\\u2014nothing at\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"probably have made little of in memory had my subsequent sojourn been less agitated. I had not gone to bed; I sat reading by a couple of candles. There was a roomful of old books at Bly\\u2014last-century fiction, some of it, which, to the extent of a distinctly deprecated renown,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"own?\\u2014what will he ever matter? I have you,\\u201d I launched at the beast, \\u201cbut he has lost you forever!\\u201d Then, for the demonstration of my work, \\u201cThere, there!\\u201d I said to Miles. But he had already jerked straight round, stared, glared again, and seen but the quiet day. With the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"sitting in pained placidity before the fire. So I see her still, so I see her best: facing the flame from her straight chair in the dusky, shining room, a large clean image of the \\u201cput away\\u201d\\u2014of drawers closed and locked and rest without a remedy. \\u201cOh, yes, they asked\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"her how, if I had \\u201cmade it up,\\u201d I came to be able to give, of each of the persons appearing to me, a picture disclosing, to the last detail, their special marks\\u2014a portrait on the exhibition of which she had instantly recognized and named them. She wished of course\\u2014small\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"adopted an attitude. \\u201cOh, never known him\\u2014I don\\u2019t pretend that!\\u201d I was upset again. \\u201cThen you have known him\\u2014?\\u201d \\u201cYes indeed, miss, thank God!\\u201d On reflection I accepted this. \\u201cYou mean that a boy who never is\\u2014?\\u201d \\u201cIs no boy for me!\\u201d I held her tighter. \\u201cYou like them with\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the coach had put him down, that I had seen him, on the instant, without and within, in the great glow of freshness, the same positive fragrance of purity, in which I had, from the first moment, seen his little sister. He was incredibly beautiful, and Mrs. Grose had put\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"thing. After all,\\u201d I said, \\u201cit\\u2019s their uncle\\u2019s fault. If he left here such people\\u2014!\\u201d \\u201cHe didn\\u2019t really in the least know them. The fault\\u2019s mine.\\u201d She had turned quite pale. \\u201cWell, you shan\\u2019t suffer,\\u201d I answered. \\u201cThe children shan\\u2019t!\\u201d she emphatically returned. I was silent awhile; we looked at\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"had known suddenly, as she lay there, that I was out of the room, and had jumped up to see what had become of me. I had dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back into my chair\\u2014feeling then, and then only, a little faint; and she had pattered straight\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the whole subject; and I was quick to assure her that my own interest in it had now violently taken the form of a search for the way to escape from it. I encountered her on the ground of a probability that with recurrence\\u2014for recurrence we took for granted\\u2014I should\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back into my chair\\u2014feeling then, and then only, a little faint; and she had pattered straight over to me, thrown herself upon my knee, given herself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the wonderful little face that was\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"there having been in the house\\u2014and for how long, above all?\\u2014a person of whom I was in ignorance. It lasted while I just bridled a little with the sense that my office demanded that there should be no such ignorance and no such person. It lasted while this visitant, at\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"chair near the wide window, then closed, the articles I wanted, but to become aware of a person on the other side of the window and looking straight in. One step into the room had sufficed; my vision was instantaneous; it was all there. The person looking straight in was\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I had already, with him, hurt myself beyond repair. Therefore I could patch up nothing, and it was too extreme an effort to squeeze beside him into the pew: he would be so much more sure than ever to pass his arm into mine and make me sit there for\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"vague relief: this was, oddly, so much to the good. It only went indeed a little way. \\u201cBut if he isn\\u2019t a gentleman\\u2014\\u201d \\u201cWhat is he? He\\u2019s a horror.\\u201d \\u201cA horror?\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s\\u2014God help me if I know what he is!\\u201d Mrs. Grose looked round once more; she fixed her eyes\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"meeting to shelter my pupils; but it took me some time to be wholly sure of what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so compromising a contract. I was queer company enough\\u2014quite as queer as the company I received; but as I trace over what we\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"as well that, left thus to myself, I was quite remarkably firm. I wandered with that manner, for the next hour or two, all over the place and looked, I have no doubt, as if I were ready for any onset. So, for the benefit of whom it might concern,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"small hope of representing with success even to her actual sympathy my sense of the real splendor of the little inspiration with which, after I had got him into the house, the boy met my final articulate challenge. As soon as I appeared in the moonlight on the terrace, he\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"where are your things?\\u201d \\u201cWhere yours are, my dear!\\u201d I promptly returned. She had already got back her gaiety, and appeared to take this as an answer quite sufficient. \\u201cAnd where\\u2019s Miles?\\u201d she went on. There was something in the small valor of it that quite finished me: these three\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"to little Flora, who, at the moment, was about ten yards away. My heart had stood still for an instant with the wonder and terror of the question whether she too would see; and I held my breath while I waited for what a cry from her, what some sudden\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the woman. It suited them all!\\u201d It suited me, too, I felt, only too well; by which I mean that it suited exactly the particularly deadly view I was in the very act of forbidding myself to entertain. But I so far succeeded in checking the expression of this view\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"for going up, the same nerve I had lately shown Quint. Well, there continued to be plenty of chance for nerve. On the eleventh night after my latest encounter with that gentleman\\u2014they were all numbered now\\u2014I had an alarm that perilously skirted it and that indeed, from the particular quality\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"prevent!\\u201d Standing there before me while I kept my seat, she visibly turned things over. \\u201cTheir uncle must do the preventing. He must take them away.\\u201d \\u201cAnd who\\u2019s to make him?\\u201d She had been scanning the distance, but she now dropped on me a foolish face. \\u201cYou, miss.\\u201d \\u201cBy writing\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"established in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper, a pencil, and a copy of nice \\u201cround O\\u2019s,\\u201d now presented herself to view at the open door. She expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment from disagreeable duties, looking to me, however, with a great childish light that\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"everything.\\u201d He gave me at this the longest and strangest look. \\u201cEverything?\\u201d \\u201cEverything. Therefore did you\\u2014?\\u201d But I couldn\\u2019t say it again. Miles could, very simply. \\u201cNo. I didn\\u2019t steal.\\u201d My face must have shown him I believed him utterly; yet my hands\\u2014but it was for pure tenderness\\u2014shook him as\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"lied and been impudent are, I confess, less engaging specimens than I had hoped to have from you of the outbreak in him of the little natural man.

I took this as a direct disproof of his having really been chastised. If he had been wicked he would have \\u201ccaught\\u201d it, and I should have caught it by the rebound\\u2014I should have found the trace. I found nothing at all,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"knew at this hour, I think, as well as I knew later, what I was capable of meeting to shelter my pupils; but it took me some time to be wholly sure of what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so compromising a contract.

He\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"inference grew in a few minutes to sharp intensity and seemed bound up with the direct perception that it was positively he who was. The frames and squares of the great window were a kind of image, for him, of a kind of failure. I felt that I saw him,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"magnificently aware of this. I felt, in a fierce rigor of confidence, that if I stood my ground a minute I should cease\\u2014for the time, at least\\u2014to have him to reckon with; and during the minute, accordingly, the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview: hideous just\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"that little girls could be slavish idolaters of little boys.

She looked intensely grave, and I had never had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired (the thrill of which had just been so prodigious) as on my consciousness that she addressed me with a reproach. \\u201cYou naughty: where have you been?\\u201d\\u2014instead of challenging\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"to confirm the details already supplied as to the cleverness of the vicarage pony.

The fact that\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"my sharper passion for them, so too I remember wondering if I mightn\\u2019t see a queerness in the traceable increase of their own demonstrations.

They were extraordinarily at one, and to say that they never either quarreled or complained is\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"an instant certainty that Flora had extinguished it. This brought me to my feet and straight, in the darkness, to her bed, which I found she had left. A glance at the window enlightened me further, and the striking of a match completed the picture. The child had again got\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"presented itself to me as the lower one\\u2014though high above the gardens\\u2014in the solid corner of the house that I have spoken of as the old tower. This was a large, square chamber, arranged with some state as a bedroom, the extravagant size of which made it so inconvenient that\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I was so slow to find anything that he had plenty of time, after a minute, to continue with his suggestive but inconclusive smile: \\u201cYou know, my dear, that for a fellow to be with a lady always\\u2014!\\u201d His \\u201cmy dear\\u201d was constantly on his lips for me, and nothing\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"had left Miles indoors, on the red cushion of a deep window seat; he had wished to finish a book, and I had been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable in a young man whose only defect was an occasional excess of the restless.

The case, I may\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"wait. We waited in fact till two nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered, he brought out what was in his mind. \\u201cI quite agree\\u2014in regard to Griffin\\u2019s ghost, or whatever it was\\u2014that its appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a particular\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"that, and I\\u2019d rather die than give you a pain or do you a wrong\\u2014I\\u2019d rather die than hurt a hair of you.

That\\u2019s how I thought, with extraordinary quickness, of each person that he might have been and that he was not. We were confronted across our distance quite long enough for me to ask myself with intensity who\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"bribed her to silence; a silence that, however, I would engage to break down on the first private opportunity. This opportunity came before tea: I secured five minutes with her in the housekeeper\\u2019s room, where, in the twilight, amid a smell of lately baked bread, but with the place all\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"with a little bang that made us look at each other\\u2014for, like all bangs, it was something louder than we had intended\\u2014the doors we had indiscreetly opened.

There was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to others my horrible confidences.

But\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"with a small invisible nudge, said to the other: \\u201cShe thinks she\\u2019ll do it this time\\u2014but she won\\u2019t!\\u201d To \\u201cdo it\\u201d would have been to indulge for instance\\u2014and for once in a way\\u2014in some direct reference to the lady who had prepared them for my discipline. They had a delightful\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"she would have been worthy of any whatever. It was long ago, and this episode was long before.

It had already lasted a minute, and it lasted while I continued, seizing my colleague, quite thrusting her at it and presenting her to it, to insist with my pointing hand. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t see\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"but it strengthened the pang with which I at that moment envied Mrs. Grose the simplicity of her relation. Still, all this while, nothing more passed between us save that Flora had let her foolish fern again drop to the ground. What she and I had virtually said to each\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I came and sat on your bed the night of the storm, that there was nothing in the world I wouldn\\u2019t do for you?\\u201d \\u201cYes, yes!\\u201d He, on his side, more and more visibly nervous, had a tone to master; but he was so much more successful than I that,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"for my lateness and, with the plea of the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as soon as possible to my room.

There were hours, from day\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"If he had given me such a bold hard stare, that was but a part of his indiscretion.

She promised to do this, and she mentioned to me that when, for a moment, disburdened, delighted, he held her hand, thanking her for the sacrifice, she already felt rewarded.\\u201d \\u201cBut was that all her reward?\\u201d one of the ladies asked. \\u201cShe never saw him again.\\u201d \\u201cOh!\\u201d said the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"\\u201cDo you mean he took it?\\u201d I gasped.

This moment dated from an afternoon hour that I happened to spend in the grounds with the younger of my pupils alone. We had left Miles indoors, on the red cushion of a deep window seat; he had wished to finish a book, and\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"rather brooded. The only thing indeed that in this early outlook might have made me shrink again was the clear circumstance of her being so glad to see me. I perceived within half an hour that she was so glad\\u2014stout, simple, plain, clean, wholesome woman\\u2014as to be positively on her\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I again push my way through it to the end. There came suddenly an hour after which, as I look back, the affair seems to me to have been all pure suffering; but I have at least reached the heart of it, and the straightest road out is doubtless to\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I could engage that, to the world, my face should tell no tales, but it would have been, in the conditions, an immense added strain to find myself anxious about hers. At the hour I now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on the terrace, where, with the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"grossness. It was all in the other quarter that, after a lull, the grossness broke out. I find that I really hang back; but I must take my plunge. In going on with the record of what was hideous at Bly, I not only challenge the most liberal faith\\u2014for which\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"person who dropped me as decent a curtsy as if I had been the mistress or a distinguished visitor.

When he at last turned round to meet me, it was almost as if this genius had succumbed. \\u201cWell, I think I\\u2019m glad Bly\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I was sorry for him! \\u201cThat you just want me not to worry you?\\u201d He looked round at me now, as if in recognition of my understanding him; then ever so gently, \\u201cTo let me alone,\\u201d he replied. There was even a singular little dignity in it, something that made\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"her greatest solicitude to the sad case presented by their instructress. That, for myself, was a sound simplification: I could engage that, to the world, my face should tell no tales, but it would have been, in the conditions, an immense added strain to find myself anxious about hers.

These children were, by the strangest of chances for a man in his position\\u2014a lone man without the right sort of experience or a grain of patience\\u2014very heavily on his hands.

Bird Study Class.\\u2014The systematic instruction of school children in bird study on a careful scientific basis in a large way really had its origin in May, 1910, when Mrs. Russell\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"often taken away from them, for along comes the tree doctor, who, in his purpose of aiding to preserve the trees, fills up the natural openings with cement and the birds are literally left out in the cold. It is plainly to be seen, therefore, that one reason why more\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"in the United States. The Secretary of Agriculture, to whose department this unusual duty was assigned, read the law thoughtfully, concluded that the task did not come within the bounds of his personal capabilities, and very wisely turned the whole matter over to a committee of three experts chosen from\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"in about twenty years, as the records show. The Ducks inhabiting the lake at this time were caught unawares. Many of them moved quickly to more Southern waters, but others tarried, evidently hoping for better times. Subsequently a few air-holes opened and the Ducks gathered about them, but there was\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the market. To-day there are not less than twenty firms engaged in their manufacture. Some of the boxes are very ornate and make beautiful additions even to the most carefully kept estate. One can buy them at prices varying from thirty-five cents to thirty-five dollars each. Among the many responsible\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the thought, for it is written that so long as man shall live, Wild Duck shall grace his table and gratify his palate. The remarkable changes which had so affected the fortunes of the wild fowl were due to the enactment of a United States law known as the Federal\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"to the game law enforcement. The Lacey Law.\\u2014The Federal Government is taking a share of the responsibility in preserving the wild life of the Union.

Variation in Families.\\u2014Sometimes there is wide variety in the character of the nests of different species\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"numbering sometimes twelve or fifteen will settle for the night in a compact circular group with heads pointed outward. When a heavy snow falls they are completely buried, and then if a hard crust forms before morning their roosting place becomes their tomb.

Some North American birds migrate southward only a few hundred miles to pass the winter, while many others go from Canada and the United States to Mexico, Central and South America.\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"movements are characteristic of various families; and when the observer is able to recognize this difference in manner a long step has been taken in acquiring the power of identifying species.

Wander where you will through every province of Canada, and almost every nook and corner of the United States, you will find that the lawmaker has been\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"great willingness to attend to their home duties, and often give evidence of keen delight while so engaged. One of the most exquisite and dainty forms of bird life found in the United States is the little Blue-gray Gnatcatcher. When occupied in building the nest, which is usually saddled on\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"become largely vegetarian in winter is the Bluebird. In summer he is passionately fond of grasshoppers, cutworms, and Arctia caterpillars, but now he wanders sadly over {88} the country of his winter range in quest of the few berries to be found in the swamps and along the hedgerows. The\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"of all kinds procurable. The various species of Terns, which were then abundant on the Jersey coast, offered the best opportunity {145} for profit, for not only were they found in vast numbers, but they were comparatively easy to shoot. Ten cents apiece was the price paid, and so lucrative\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"that they may be recalled later with sufficient accuracy to identify the singer. It is well to keep a list of the species observed when on a trip. For many years in my field excursions I have kept careful lists of the birds seen and identified, and have found these\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"Egrets and other water birds, and to educate public sentiment to a proper appreciation of the importance of bird protection. She has typewritten a four-hundred-page book on birds and bird protection, has acknowledged the receipt of letters from the wardens telling of desperate rifle battles that they have had with\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"an absolutely helpless condition, being both blind and naked, and it is necessary that they be fed by the parents, not only while occupying the nest, but also for several weeks afterward. To this group belong most of the small birds we are accustomed to see about the house. When\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"have the strength to do this, but their bodies being covered with down they are protected from the sun or cold. Examples of such birds are the Quail, Grouse, Sandpipers, Plovers, and Ducks.

Destructiveness of Insects.\\u2014If we go back a few years and examine certain widely read publications issued by the United States Department of Agriculture, we can understand\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"Fridays to come. They used often to ask, 'Is to-morrow Bird Day, Miss Beth?' and if I answered in the affirmative, I heard 'Oh, goody,' [248] and 'I won't forget to wear my button,' and 'I wonder what bird it will be,' from every side. Rarely ever did we have\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the eaves of verandas, or {86} on the rafters of bridges. Many creep into cracks of outhouses. I have found them at night in caves, barns, and once in a covered wagon. Almost any available shelter may have its bird tenant on cold nights, who if undisturbed will often return\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"to dig a nesting hole in a living tree, such work of the axeman means that when the season comes for the rearing of young, all mated Woodpeckers must move on to where more natural conditions await them. This results in an abnormal reduction of the number of holes for\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"with floating plants that Greene called \\\"wild lettuce.\\\" These appeared to be uniform in size, and presented an absolutely level surface except in a few places where slight elevations indicated the presence of inquisitive alligators, whose gray eyes we knew were watching our movements through the lettuce leaves. Although the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"Audubon Class brought about this change in the boy.\\\" Junior Game Protectors.\\u2014Another leader reported from Nashville that the one thousand junior members in the schools there had turned into voluntary bird wardens, and spied upon every man or boy who went afield with a gun.

Why Birds Migrate.\\u2014Why birds migrate we can only conjecture. Without doubt the growing scarcity of food\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the warden in charge that they had regained their confidence in man. At Lake Worth I saw a gentleman feed Scaup Ducks that swam to within two yards of his boat.

The Grebe, or \\\"Water Witch,\\\" builds one of the most remarkable nests of any American bird. It is a floating raft, the buoyant part of which is the green {38} stems of water\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"way for hundreds of miles across the trackless ocean. Terns, Gulls, and Murres are known to go many miles in quest of food for their young and return through dense fogs with unerring directness to their nests. During the spring it is not uncommon for strange waterfowl to be found\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"Fails.\\u2014It is hard to realize the extent of the havoc wrought among birds by cold, snowy weather. Early in the year 1895 a long, severe cold spell, accompanied by snow and sleet, almost exterminated the Bluebird in the eastern United States.

A month or two later when the stubs of the quills have become dry they\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"late in April, or in May, there might have been a different tale to tell. September might also have yielded more birds than June, for September is a season when the migrants are with us for a time.
