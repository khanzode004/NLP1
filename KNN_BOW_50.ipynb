Six o\\u2019clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently near to Mr. Utterson\\u2019s dwelling, and still he was digging at the problem.

But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at last overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my tincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a large quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in the person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without pecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I began to profit by the strange immunities of my position. Men\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"which I looked back upon these hours. A change had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it was the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received Lanyon\\u2019s condemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came home\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"he remained behind after the others had departed. This was no new arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of times. Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had already their foot on the threshold;\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like Queer Street, the less I ask.\\u201d \\u201cA very good rule, too,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cBut I have studied the place for myself,\\u201d continued Mr. Enfield. \\u201cIt seems scarcely a house.

A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the wind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so that as\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"these together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. \\u201cThere must be something else,\\u201d said the perplexed gentleman. \\u201cThere is something more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"a great esteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies. Next, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came to the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary horror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"feelings, much as I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still alive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that door.\\u201d \\u201cAh, Mr. Utterson, that\\u2019s talking!\\u201d cried the butler. \\u201cAnd now comes the second question,\\u201d resumed Utterson: \\u201cWho is going to do\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"and take a quick turn with us.\\u201d \\u201cYou are very good,\\u201d sighed the other. \\u201cI should like to very much; but no, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson, I am very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"cabinet is then to be forced; and you are to go in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand, breaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, with all its contents as they stand, the fourth drawer from the top or (which\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"returned to his old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment, friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were wrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"taking the air with an infinite sadness of mien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll. \\u201cWhat! Jekyll!\\u201d he cried. \\u201cI trust you are better.\\u201d \\u201cI am very low, Utterson,\\u201d replied the doctor drearily, \\u201cvery low. It will not last long, thank God.\\u201d \\u201cYou stay too much indoors,\\u201d said\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"many papers had been burned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end of a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the other half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched his suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"for his face was white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken. \\u201cWell, sir,\\u201d he said, \\u201chere we are, and God grant there be nothing wrong.\\u201d \\u201cAmen, Poole,\\u201d said the lawyer. Thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was opened on the chain; and\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"then he begged Mr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden. \\u201cNow, sir,\\u201d said he, \\u201cyou come as gently as you can. I want you to hear, and I don\\u2019t want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any chance he was\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"I have to ask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own hand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from my cabinet.

In silence, too, they traversed the by-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring thoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings of life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion. They\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"should be back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before midnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor foreseen, but because an hour when your servants\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"eyes\\u2014pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with his hands, like a man restored from death\\u2014there stood Henry Jekyll! What he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on paper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"by the house, my own servants would consign me to the gallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and thought of Lanyon. How was he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing that I escaped capture in the streets, how was I to make my way into his presence? and\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"streets unusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had never seen that part of London so deserted.

Certain agents I found to have the power to shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter deeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir, I used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more glad to get away.\\u201d \\u201cJekyll is ill, too,\\u201d observed Utterson. \\u201cHave you seen him?\\u201d But Lanyon\\u2019s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand.\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"light in the dining-room?\\u201d \\u201cHere, thank you,\\u201d said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the tall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy of his friend the doctor\\u2019s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of it as the pleasantest\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"solemnly all around; but nearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a footfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor. \\u201cSo it will walk all day, sir,\\u201d whispered Poole; \\u201cay, and the better part of the night. Only when a new sample comes from\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"the laboratory table. I began to perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling immateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body in which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"them uninterrupted. It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must be careful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire catastrophe.\\u201d \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you read it, sir?\\u201d asked Poole. \\u201cBecause I fear,\\u201d replied the lawyer solemnly. \\u201cGod grant I have no cause for it!\\u201d And\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"found it out, did you?\\u201d said Utterson. \\u201cBut if that be so, we may step into the court and take a look at the windows.

But it bore no postmark. The note was handed in.\\u201d \\u201cShall I keep this and sleep\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was conscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more furious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to the\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"O, I know it\\u2019s not evidence, Mr. Utterson; I\\u2019m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I give you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!\\u201d \\u201cAy, ay,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cMy fears incline to the same point. Evil, I fear, founded\\u2014evil was sure to come\\u2014of that\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"life as a whole: I followed it up from the days of childhood, when I had walked with my father\\u2019s hand, and through the self-denying toils of my professional life, to arrive again and again, with the same sense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the evening. I could\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house.

And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to him closer than a wife, closer than an\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"unjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"contents. The will was holograph, for Mr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided not only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"raged. With a transport of glee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow; and it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was suddenly, in the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror. A mist dispersed;\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest.

It was already bad enough when the name was but a\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"puffs and draughts into that deep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about their steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where they sat down silently to wait.

It was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"and the most deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then as in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in the temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a solution of the bonds of obligation. I looked\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"transfigures, its clay continent?

Well, sir, every day, ay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and complaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists in town. Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another paper telling me\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"carrying to the post, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.

No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like Queer Street, the less I ask.\\u201d \\u201cA very good rule, too,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cBut I have studied the place for myself,\\u201d continued Mr. Enfield. \\u201cIt seems scarcely a house. There is no\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"clearly seeing him. I had never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as I have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his face, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and great apparent debility of constitution, and\\u2014last but not\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"upstairs into the cabinet. It was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my head like quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon his face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"my orders, led me to a private room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was astute; mastered his fury with a\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"old dissecting room, Poole,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIs that right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?\\u201d \\u201cQuite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,\\u201d replied the servant. \\u201cMr. Hyde has a key.\\u201d \\u201cYour master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man, Poole,\\u201d resumed the other musingly. \\u201cYes, sir, he\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"independent denizens. I, for my part, from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in one direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own person, that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man; I saw that, of the\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"improvement I had already learned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse. Even at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a life of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my pleasures were (to say the least)\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be the old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul that thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"lane, which the maid\\u2019s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the full moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon her box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a dream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she narrated\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"spoke, harsh and broken. \\u201cWell, sir,\\u201d he said, \\u201chere we are, and God grant there be nothing wrong.\\u201d \\u201cAmen, Poole,\\u201d said the lawyer. Thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was opened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, \\u201cIs that you, Poole?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"theatre, where they sat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but nearer at hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a footfall moving to and fro along the cabinet floor. \\u201cSo it will walk all day, sir,\\u201d whispered Poole; \\u201cay, and the better part\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll\\u2019s Will and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for Mr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"\\u201cWhy did you compare them, Guest?\\u201d he inquired suddenly. \\u201cWell, sir,\\u201d returned the clerk, \\u201cthere\\u2019s a rather singular resemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only differently sloped.\\u201d \\u201cRather quaint,\\u201d said Utterson. \\u201cIt is, as you say, rather quaint,\\u201d returned Guest. \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t speak of this note, you\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"should it mean? A great curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries; but professional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent obligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his private safe. It is\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward Hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in the name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by opening an account at another bank in the\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"paved with flags, warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. \\u201cWill you wait here by the fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?\\u201d \\u201cHere, thank you,\\u201d said the lawyer, and he drew\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being inherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered on self; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture to another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at times aghast before the acts of\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"startling clause of the will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred. From that\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"always sure that he kept as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the doctor\\u2019s; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr. Hyde\\u2019s familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it not as well, then, that he should see\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"the list and followed by several marks of exclamation, \\u201ctotal failure!!!\\u201d All this, though it whetted my curiosity, told me little that was definite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of experiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll\\u2019s investigations) to no\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"an experiment in which the unhappy man had been prevented. \\u201cThat is the same drug that I was always bringing him,\\u201d said Poole; and even as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over. This brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn cosily up, and\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to reflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities of my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of projecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed to\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of my own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange array; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"pang along my blood. \\u201cCome, sir,\\u201d said I. \\u201cYou forget that I have not yet the pleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.\\u201d And I showed him an example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"doesn\\u2019t commend itself to reason.\\u201d \\u201cWell, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I\\u2019ll do it yet,\\u201d said Poole. \\u201cAll this last week (you must know) him, or it, whatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and day for some sort of\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"and having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost daily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The fifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook himself to Dr. Lanyon\\u2019s. There at least\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and several enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"appearance of Edward Hyde. I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but that which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature, to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust and less developed than the good\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"seem a very popular character,\\u201d observed the latter. \\u201cAnd now, my good woman, just let me and this gentleman have a look about us.\\u201d In the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"went into his business room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll\\u2019s Will and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for Mr. Utterson though he took charge\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"in his study, a man who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry Jekyll. The pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have said, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the hands of Edward Hyde, they soon began\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"God, sir,\\u201d exclaimed the officer, \\u201cis it possible?\\u201d And the next moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. \\u201cThis will make a deal of noise,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd perhaps you can help us to the man.\\u201d And he briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"was Jekyll\\u2019s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance. Nowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive. Poole stamped on\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"But that\\u2019s not all. I don\\u2019t know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr. Hyde?\\u201d \\u201cYes,\\u201d said the lawyer, \\u201cI once spoke with him.\\u201d \\u201cThen you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something queer about that gentleman\\u2014something that gave a man a turn\\u2014I\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"he called my scientific heresies. O, I know he\\u2019s a good fellow\\u2014you needn\\u2019t frown\\u2014an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of him; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant. I was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.\\u201d \\u201cYou know I never\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger. Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain sinister block of building thrust forward its\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"first moment of his entrance, struck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable; his clothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober fabric, were enormously too large for him\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"and I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my part, from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in one direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"himself up at the word with a start, and then conquering the weakness\\u2014\\u201cwhat could Jekyll want with it?\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou may say that!\\u201d said Poole. Next they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"door was open, and there he was at the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up when I came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet. It was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"made me what I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men, severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound man\\u2019s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that hard law of life,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"gallows. My reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more than once observed that in my second character, my faculties seemed sharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came about that, where Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"the letter had run composedly enough, but here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer\\u2019s emotion had broken loose. \\u201cFor God\\u2019s sake,\\u201d he added, \\u201cfind me some of the old.\\u201d \\u201cThis is a strange note,\\u201d said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, \\u201cHow do you come to have it\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"had no face by which he might know it; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer\\u2019s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"had always been known for charities, he was now no less distinguished for religion.

The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the letter ran: \\u201cDear Lanyon,\\u2014You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at least\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"full of winter chirrupings and sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench; the animal within me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a little drowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to begin. After all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours;\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"lawyer led up to the subject which so disagreeably preoccupied his mind. \\u201cI suppose, Lanyon,\\u201d said he, \\u201cyou and I must be the two oldest friends that Henry Jekyll has?\\u201d \\u201cI wish the friends were younger,\\u201d chuckled Dr. Lanyon. \\u201cBut I suppose we are. And what of that? I see\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"for it. God bless me, the man seems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be the old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul that thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The last, I think; for, O\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"nodded. \\u201cYes,\\u201d said he, \\u201cI recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir Danvers Carew.\\u201d \\u201cGood God, sir,\\u201d exclaimed the officer, \\u201cis it possible?\\u201d And the next moment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. \\u201cThis will make a deal of noise,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd perhaps you\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"and still with an occasional awestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine the contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"aware that, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away like a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save \\u201cP.S.\\u2014I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my soul. It is possible that the post-office may fail me,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"the premonitory shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed me; since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double, and once, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment. Now, however,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"whetted my curiosity, told me little that was definite. Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of experiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll\\u2019s investigations) to no end of practical usefulness. How could the presence of these articles in my house affect\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"have studied the place for myself,\\u201d continued Mr. Enfield. \\u201cIt seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"had been, after all, nine tenths a life of effort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much less exhausted.

And at the very moment of that vainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the most deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then as in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in the temper of\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"away, he took up a candle and went into his business room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll\\u2019s Will and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"echoed Poole. \\u201cDo you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a man had stamped on it.\\u201d \\u201cAy,\\u201d continued Utterson, \\u201cand the fractures, too, are rusty.\\u201d The two men looked at each other with a scare. \\u201cThis is beyond me, Poole,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cLet us go back\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"from the ground, the waist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar sprawling wide upon his shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous accoutrement was far from moving me to laughter. Rather, as there was something abnormal and misbegotten in the very essence of the creature that now faced\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"and looked at his companion. They were both pale; and there was an answering horror in their eyes. \\u201cGod forgive us, God forgive us,\\u201d said Mr. Utterson. But Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once more in silence. Mr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer\\u2019s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but once set eyes on him,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"and I made my preparations with the most studious care. I took and furnished that house in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as a housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and unscrupulous. On the other side, I announced to my\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"Hyde would be not even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"the open air, he did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an inward consciousness of service; and for more than two months, the doctor was at peace. On the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor\\u2019s with a small party; Lanyon had been\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"learned to despair. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse. Even at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a life of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method of its own. The police of the division have\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"its own terrors. Here, in a case where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some cause or other, the things not personal\\u2014even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attached\\u2014do not seem to reach her. It is something like the way\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"fell a-trembling, and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague. At last, after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:\\u2014\\u201cJack, is she really dead?\\u201dI assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest\\u2014for I felt that such a horrible doubt should\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"\\u2019ere; I never \\u2019eard of \\u2019im in all my bloomin\\u2019 days. Don\\u2019t believe there ain\\u2019t nobody of that kind livin\\u2019 ere or anywheres.\\u201d I took out Smollet\\u2019s letter, and as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief; at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come, I tell you what I propose: first,\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"there ever is over snow; and it seemed as though the snow-flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments. All was in dead, grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered, as if in terror of the worst. I began to fear\\u2014horrible fears;\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"we seek, when none are near to see, we shall open the box, and\\u2014and all will be well.\\u201d\\u201cI shall not wait for any opportunity,\\u201d said Morris. \\u201cWhen I see the box I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a thousand men looking on, and if I\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"these two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, I cannot understand what you are driving at.\\u201d\\u201cI accept your limitation,\\u201d said Van Helsing, \\u201cand all I ask of you is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"area below.

For a good while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"and laid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat. I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat. She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen her.Van Helsing called in\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"a space of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence, and I could fancy that I could hear the sound of our hearts beating; then Van Helsing said, placing his hand very tenderly on Mrs. Harker\\u2019s head:\\u2014\\u201cAnd now, Madam Mina\\u2014poor, dear, dear Madam Mina\\u2014tell us exactly what happened. God\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound.

Amid the crash and glitter of\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"this style of conversation might not be pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:\\u2014\\u201cHow did you know I wanted to marry any one?\\u201d His reply was simply contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs. Harker to\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"so consulted about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child. So finally we decided\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at this day.

Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he waited. He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on his mother\\u2019s lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor. \\u201cFather, Mother\\u201d, said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"loud enough for his sister to hear him. \\u201cGregor\\u201d, said his father now from the room to his left, \\u201cthe chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn\\u2019t leave on the early train. We don\\u2019t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"needed to enter the room but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened no more that night and\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements. \\u201cMy child\\u201d, said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding, \\u201cwhat are we to do?\\u201d His sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainty. \\u201cIf he could\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"enough and that his father took it to mean that something bad had happened, that he was responsible for some act of violence. That meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"lost his ability to see anything\\u2014her hands behind his father\\u2019s head begging him to spare Gregor\\u2019s life. No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor\\u2019s flesh, so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury. He had suffered it there for more than a month, and his\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"had been yearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He never wanted to let her out\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"He was amazed at the great distance that separated him from his room, and could not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little while before and almost without noticing it. He concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"First of all though, I\\u2019ve got to get up, my train leaves at five.\\u201d And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. \\u201cGod in Heaven!\\u201d he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position all that secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I don\\u2019t see why your parents should not also learn of it.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"calmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight o\\u2019clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself one\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"hurried back under the couch. But he needed great self-control to stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could hardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force. Gregor\\u2019s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk\\u2019s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"room on his right, Gregor\\u2019s sister whispered to him to let him know: \\u201cGregor, the chief clerk is here.\\u201d \\u201cYes, I know\\u201d, said Gregor to himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him. \\u201cGregor\\u201d, said his father now from the room to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"they looked up in irritation. \\u201cWell?\\u201d, asked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you had to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this question, the chief clerk\\u2019s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"empty. And on the very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged Gregor\\u2019s mother to let her go without delay. It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor\\u2019s mother\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"some way, even if only in secret. For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they should do now; but even between meals they spoke about the same subject as there were always at least two members of the family at home\\u2014nobody wanted to be\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"arm. \\u201cLeave my home. Now!\\u201d, said Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and without letting the women from him. \\u201cWhat do you mean?\\u201d, asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly. The other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them together in\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of it. We\\u2019ve done all that\\u2019s humanly possible to look after it and be patient, I don\\u2019t think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong.\\u201d \\u201cShe\\u2019s absolutely right\\u201d, said Gregor\\u2019s father to himself. His mother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He never wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his body. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was his father\\u2019s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that they\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"again. Gregor was so resentful of it that he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like a kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"he managed quite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him that if he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"all directions. \\u201cWhat is it you want then?\\u201d, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most respect for. \\u201cYes\\u201d, she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, \\u201cwell then, that thing in there, you needn\\u2019t worry about how you\\u2019re going to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the chief clerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for the last time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt down several steps at once\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor\\u2019s mother and sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"old stuff, shall we. Come and give me a bit of attention\\u201d. The two women immediately did as he said, hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters. After that, the three of them left the flat together, which was\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet. \\u201cMother, mother\\u201d, said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help himself snapping in the air with his\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about it last Christmas\\u2014had Christmas really come and gone already?\\u2014if this\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed. Then, however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was quiet, maybe that was a good sign. Then there was someone at the door. The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and answer it. His father had arrived home. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too. Then, without his willing it, his head sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils. When the cleaner came in early\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"finished before Gregor\\u2019s father got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another thing it wasn\\u2019t even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him. She thought just the opposite; the sight\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"stick in his father\\u2019s hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it was cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while. She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while, knowing\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the town. They had the tram, filled with warm sunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on their seats, they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at all bad\\u2014until then they had never asked each other about their work but all three had jobs\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"a word and left the premises. Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust the men\\u2019s intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"sometimes take their evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening. But Gregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often failed to make\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright with his mouth,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive. So then\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about it last Christmas\\u2014had Christmas really come and gone already?\\u2014if this misfortune hadn\\u2019t got in the way, and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive. So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first, carefully turning his head to the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"running as his father had decided to bombard him. He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"she stepped to one side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw screamed: \\u201cOh God, oh God!\\u201d Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"who would place his stick down carefully and, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his companions around him. He was standing up straight enough now; dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute; above\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"could be seen that he was not sleeping at all. Throughout all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him. His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to move. He\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"it\\u2019s almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don\\u2019t usually even hear about them, or if at all it\\u2019s when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that\\u2019s when we feel the harmful effects of what\\u2019s been going on without even knowing what caused\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his sister. All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room, although that was in itself quite startling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required a great deal of effort and\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"father now from the room to his left, \\u201cthe chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn\\u2019t leave on the early train. We don\\u2019t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to speak to you personally. So please open up this door. I\\u2019m\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"keep up this running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to carry out countless movements. He became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable. Now, as he lurched about in his efforts to muster all\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you had to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this question, the chief clerk\\u2019s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that yet. Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family. For the time being\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"lots of little white spots which he didn\\u2019t know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"straight to the window and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it was cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while.

Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of March, after all. The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts; they had been forgotten about. \\u201cWhere is our breakfast?\\u201d, the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"flapped around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work; everything else was looked after by Gregor\\u2019s mother on top of the large amount of sewing work she did. Gregor even learned, listening to the evening conversation about what price they had hoped for, that several\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it\\u2019s almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don\\u2019t usually even hear about them, or if at all it\\u2019s\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"was not something that she would be able to do by herself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough. It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that he could\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, the more that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher\\u2019s boy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer than they were,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at infant school\\u2014he really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women\\u2019s intentions were good. He had nearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen completely asleep. He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut, bolted and locked. The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that his little legs collapsed under him. It was his sister who had been\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"that he must go away even more strongly than his sister. He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning. He watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too. Then, without his willing\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of times a year when they went for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always labour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking slowly for his sake; who would\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"makes you stupid. You\\u2019ve got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts. I ought to just try\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see his mother until later\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible. So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he came in from the hall, could see straight away that Gregor had the best intentions\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"eyes, look at them one after the other and say: \\u201cWhat a life! This is what peace I get in my old age!\\u201d And supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself, let the women take him to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"pressed her face into his chest: \\u201cMother\\u2019s fainted, but she\\u2019s better now. Gregor got out.\\u201d \\u201cJust as I expected\\u201d, said his father, \\u201cjust as I always said, but you women wouldn\\u2019t listen, would you.\\u201d It was clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father took\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"room without delay, that it would not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would disappear. His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that; \\u201cAh!\\u201d, he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"might come into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He never wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him. Two strong people\\u2014he had his father and the maid in mind\\u2014would have been more than enough; they would only have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to speak to him in that way once again. Gregor was so resentful of it that he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you\\u2019ll be amazed how nice it is; it\\u2019s hanging up in his room; you\\u2019ll see it as soon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I\\u2019m glad you\\u2019re here; we wouldn\\u2019t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position. \\u201cGetting up early all the time\\u201d, he thought, \\u201cit makes you stupid. You\\u2019ve got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"he lay there immobile. \\u201cWe have to try and get rid of it\\u201d, said Gregor\\u2019s sister, now speaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to listen, \\u201cit\\u2019ll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. We can\\u2019t all work as\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"aware that Gregor, against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. \\u201cGregor, Gregor\\u201d, he called, \\u201cwhat\\u2019s wrong?\\u201d And after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: \\u201cGregor! Gregor!\\u201d\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"into the floor, the desk where he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at infant school\\u2014he really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women\\u2019s intentions were good. He had nearly forgotten they were there anyway, as\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"o\\u2019clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor\\u2019s not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss\\u2019s man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five years of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"it\\u2019s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there\\u2019s still some hope; once I\\u2019ve got the money together to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"come into the room to see him. He would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"word of all that?\\u201d the chief clerk asked his parents, \\u201csurely he\\u2019s not trying to make fools of us\\u201d. \\u201cOh, God!\\u201d called his mother, who was already in tears, \\u201che could be seriously ill and we\\u2019re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!\\u201d she then cried. \\u201cMother?\\u201d his sister called from the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"and her fingers spread shouting: \\u201cHelp, for pity\\u2019s sake, Help!\\u201d The way she held her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the breakfast things\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on. If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite her. Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course, but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of it. Nothing should be removed; everything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage. His sister, unfortunately, did\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening. There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening, when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up again\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. An apple thrown without\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"himself. This was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning while his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would sleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor\\u2019s\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"object and the hand that held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"sister whispered: \\u201cGregor, open the door, I beg of you.\\u201d Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home. The first thing he wanted to do\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"in their own room but, since they had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate, especially if it was dirty. They had moreover brought most of their own furnishings and equipment with them. For\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest gentlemen\\u2014all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door one day\\u2014were painfully insistent on things\\u2019 being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides. It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out, and now it was easy to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little, and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention. She soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself, but\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"if nailed to the spot and spread himself out, all his senses in confusion. The last thing he saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his sister had taken off some\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"show that you grant that I\\u2019m at least partly right!\\u201d But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment while\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"come with us in here for a little while\\u201d, said Mrs. Samsa with a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide. Although it was still early in the morning\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his father was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn. If only his father would stop that unbearable hissing! It\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen. It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"rush forward from under the couch, throw himself at his sister\\u2019s feet and beg her for something good to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise. She immediately picked it up\\u2014using a\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"not want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than they could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough. It was\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"still for a moment while Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"home by themselves and it was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty. And on the very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged Gregor\\u2019s mother to let her go without delay. It was not very clear how much she knew of what\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"chasing him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in front of her. From then on she never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him. At first she would\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"very clear how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor\\u2019s mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service. She even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened, even\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let himself fall against the back of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what\\u2019s more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"left his sister began to cry. So why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she crying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway. What\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"Gregor had been bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution. He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father\\u2019s debt to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor\\u2019s room. They did so, and stood around Gregor\\u2019s corpse with their hands in the pockets of their well-worn coats. It was now quite light in the room. Then the door of the bedroom opened and Mr.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"left on the walls, here and there were little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it;\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"were always at least two members of the family at home\\u2014nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty. And on the very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged Gregor\\u2019s mother to let\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon. Then there was a ring at the door of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was only later, when she had become a little more used to everything\\u2014there was, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the situation\\u2014that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at least\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"mother, but nothing would have any effect on him. He would just sink deeper into his chair. Only when the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: \\u201cWhat a life! This is what peace I\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"in the next room without knowing it. They asked Gregor\\u2019s father for explanations, raised their arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor\\u2019s sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send the housekeeper for it, but then his father would close the matter with a big, loud \\u201cNo\\u201d, and no more would be said. Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook. So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half of his body could be seen, along with\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the gentleman happened to have placed it\\u2014out of the way in a corner. His sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one on each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for Gregor\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence. His mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his father with her arms around his neck. \\u201cMaybe now they\\u2019ll let me turn\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"shut the door and opened the window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of March, after all. The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes. Gregor\\u2019s sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead. Her words seemed to give Gregor\\u2019s father some more definite ideas. He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway. He did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"any direction, but it would also have let him quickly forget his past when he had still been human. He had come very close to forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for so long, that had shaken him out of it. Nothing should be\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the time for careful aim, threw one apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. An apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor\\u2019s back and slid off without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"she soon stopped speaking and helped Gregor\\u2019s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she had. The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women pushed the chest\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"he was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. All of them were usually very quiet nowadays. Soon after dinner, his father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"came in, not every day of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand everything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was still just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult\\u2019s appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"shaken him out of it. Nothing should be removed; everything had to stay; he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on his condition; and if the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage. His\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"little and already had his head in the living room. Before, he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others. What\\u2019s more, there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"big, loud \\u201cNo\\u201d, and no more would be said. Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained to Gregor\\u2019s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were. Now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not from\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought it was\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all around the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor\\u2019s father\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to be.\\u201d \\u201cBut Sir\\u201d, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement, \\u201cI\\u2019ll open up immediately, just a moment. I\\u2019m slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven\\u2019t\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway. What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"player himself. The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited. Gregor\\u2019s father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister with the violin. She calmly prepared everything for her to begin playing; his parents, who had never rented a room out before and\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"them more harshly than he should. And you\\u2019re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it\\u2019s almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"hungrier than he had been that morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly covering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back again in disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it difficult to eat the food\\u2014he was only\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It\\u2019s not quite as easy as I\\u2019d thought. I\\u2019m quite alright now, though. It\\u2019s shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural force waiting to save him.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders, Mrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is how they went into Gregor\\u2019s room. On the way they opened the door to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in; she was\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead of them he only had all those little legs\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"some act of violence. That meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible. So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to be in an empty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting Gregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone of her voice, as she was convinced that he did not understand her words, she added \\u201cand by taking the furniture away,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful. As soon as it struck ten, Gregor\\u2019s mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn\\u2019t sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"treated as an enemy. On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient. Because of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility\\u2014probably permanently. He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his father. He really had not imagined his father the way he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about, he had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way he had done before. He really ought to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"rolled in front of him. It was an apple; then another one immediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard him. He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"\\u201cThat\\u2019s what I said\\u201d, replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor\\u2019s body another shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor. Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete it. \\u201cNow then\\u201d, said Mr. Samsa,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"through her tears as a sign that of that there was no question. \\u201cIf he could just understand us\\u201d, repeated Gregor\\u2019s father, closing his eyes in acceptance of his sister\\u2019s certainty that that was quite impossible, \\u201cthen perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement with him. But as\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"it was easy to see that his parents and sister had stayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come into Gregor\\u2019s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"on the spot. And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the others didn\\u2019t know what was happening, they were worried, that would excuse their behaviour. The chief clerk now raised his voice,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his body. Now they did become a little\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: \\u201cHelp, for pity\\u2019s sake, Help!\\u201d The way she held her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"leave him to it. At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood\\u2014cleaning up Gregor\\u2019s room was for her and her alone. Gregor\\u2019s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"than me, I had a small symptom of it last night already. They must have noticed it. I don\\u2019t know why I didn\\u2019t let you know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home. Please, don\\u2019t make my parents suffer! There\\u2019s no\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"take long strides into the front hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said. Now they jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr. Samsa might go into the hallway in\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his mother and put her hand on her forehead. Her words seemed to give Gregor\\u2019s father some more definite ideas. He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"but it was like a kind of attack. Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth open, clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her hand had been slammed down into\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"go somewhere?\\u201d That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"stop it straight away.\\u201d \\u201cOn the contrary\\u201d, said the middle gentleman, \\u201cwould the young lady not like to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much more cosy and comfortable?\\u201d \\u201cOh yes, we\\u2019d love to\\u201d, called back Gregor\\u2019s father as if he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"for a businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And you\\u2019re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a cautious knock at the door near his head. \\u201cGregor\\u201d, somebody called\\u2014it was his mother\\u2014\\u201cit\\u2019s quarter to seven. Didn\\u2019t you want to go somewhere?\\u201d That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work, but that\\u2019s just the right time to remember what\\u2019s been achieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration. You\\u2019re well aware that I\\u2019m\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his room without delay, that it would not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would disappear. His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that; \\u201cAh!\\u201d, he shouted as he came in, sounding as if\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place.

Proofs, I say, yes\\u2014from the moment I really took hold. This moment dated from an afternoon hour that I happened to spend in the grounds with the younger of my pupils alone. We had left Miles indoors, on the red cushion of a deep window\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth. The departing ladies who had said they would stay didn\\u2019t, of course, thank heaven, stay: they departed, in consequence of arrangements made, in a rage of curiosity,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"we each felt the importance of not provoking\\u2014on the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the children\\u2014any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of mysteries. I drew a great security in this particular from her mere smooth aspect. There was nothing\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I was there! What I felt the next day was, I suppose, nothing that could be fairly called a reaction from the cheer of my arrival; it was probably at the most only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of the scale, as I walked round them, gazed\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"she afterward showed was that he put the whole thing to her as a kind of favor, an obligation he should gratefully incur. She conceived him as rich, but as fearfully extravagant\\u2014saw him all in a glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming ways with\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"my head at her. \\u201cIf I had ever doubted, all my doubt would at present have gone. I\\u2019ve been living with the miserable truth, and now it has only too much closed round me. Of course I\\u2019ve lost you: I\\u2019ve interfered, and you\\u2019ve seen\\u2014under her dictation\\u201d\\u2014with which I faced, over\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"year, to go home, as she said, for a short holiday, to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right. We had then a young woman\\u2014a nursemaid who had stayed on and who was a good girl and clever; and she took the children altogether\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"explained, for that matter, with the loveliest, eagerest simplicity. She had known suddenly, as she lay there, that I was out of the room, and had jumped up to see what had become of me. I had dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back into my chair\\u2014feeling then, and\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"and dread, I remained where I had had my collision; I only recall that when I re-entered the house darkness had quite closed in. Agitation, in the interval, certainly had held me and driven me, for I must, in circling about the place, have walked three miles; but I was\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"my function\\u2014in her patience under my pain. She offered her mind to my disclosures as, had I wished to mix a witch\\u2019s broth and proposed it with assurance, she would have held out a large clean saucepan. This had become thoroughly her attitude by the time that, in my recital\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"my appearance, she knew nothing whatever that could bear upon the incident I had there ready for her. I had not suspected in advance that her comfortable face would pull me up, and I somehow measured the importance of what I had seen by my thus finding myself hesitate to\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"lovely childish forehead. The face that was close to mine was as white as the face against the glass, and out of it presently came a sound, not low nor weak, but as if from much further away, that I drank like a waft of fragrance. \\u201cYes\\u2014I took it.\\u201d At\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"carriage.\\u201d I forthwith expressed that the proper as well as the pleasant and friendly thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public conveyance I should be in waiting for him with his little sister; an idea in which Mrs. Grose concurred so heartily that I somehow took\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"their names.\\u201d \\u201cWere they then so many?\\u201d \\u201cNo\\u2014only a few.

From our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on the stair; whereupon Mrs. Griffin spoke. \\u201cWell, if I don\\u2019t know who she was in love with, I know who he was.\\u201d \\u201cShe was ten years older,\\u201d said her husband. \\u201cRaison\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"with this that I became aware of having Mrs. Grose also, and very formidably, to reckon with. My elder companion, the next moment, at any rate, blotted out everything but her own flushed face and her loud, shocked protest, a burst of high disapproval. \\u201cWhat a dreadful turn, to be\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"delicate way to ease me off. Wasn\\u2019t there light in the fact which, as we shared our solitude, broke out with a specious glitter it had never yet quite worn?\\u2014the fact that (opportunity aiding, precious opportunity which had now come) it would be preposterous, with a child so endowed, to\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"village, would be a matter of twenty minutes. Coming downstairs to meet my colleague in the hall, I remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and that had received them\\u2014with a publicity perhaps not edifying\\u2014while I sat with the children at their tea, served on Sundays, by\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"do them!\\u2014 I nodded at the house. \\u201cThe children?\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t leave them now.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re afraid\\u2014?\\u201d I spoke boldly. \\u201cI\\u2019m afraid of him.\\u201d Mrs. Grose\\u2019s large face showed me, at this, for the first time, the faraway faint glimmer of a consciousness more acute: I somehow made out in it\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"had probably more than anything else to do with the restlessness that, before morning, made me several times rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and prospect; to watch, from my open window, the faint summer dawn, to look at such portions of the rest\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"was more nervous than I could bear to be as that I was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for the truth I had now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth that I could arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom I had been so\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"would leave, on the spot, both him and you.\\u201d It was all very well to join them, but speaking to them proved quite as much as ever an effort beyond my strength\\u2014offered, in close quarters, difficulties as insurmountable as before. This situation continued a month, and with new aggravations and\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"\\u201cYou came for me for church, of course, but I can\\u2019t go.\\u201d \\u201cHas anything happened?\\u201d \\u201cYes. You must know now. Did I look very queer?\\u201d \\u201cThrough this window? Dreadful!\\u201d \\u201cWell,\\u201d I said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve been frightened.\\u201d Mrs. Grose\\u2019s eyes expressed plainly that she had no wish to be, yet also that\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"all, I\\u2019m a fellow, don\\u2019t you see? that\\u2019s\\u2014well, getting on.\\u201d I lingered there with him an instant ever so kindly. \\u201cYes, you\\u2019re getting on.\\u201d Oh, but I felt helpless! I have kept to this day the heartbreaking little idea of how he seemed to know that and to play with\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"and wet feet, went as soon as possible to my room. Here it was another affair; here, for many days after, it was a queer affair enough. There were hours, from day to day\\u2014or at least there were moments, snatched even from clear duties\\u2014when I had to shut myself up\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"as tigers and as Romans, but as Shakespeareans, astronomers, and navigators. This was so singularly the case that it had presumably much to do with the fact as to which, at the present day, I am at a loss for a different explanation: I allude to my unnatural composure on\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"my employer. Yet it appeared to me that we were all, at Bly, sufficiently sacrificed to make that venial. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think your uncle much cares.\\u201d Miles, on this, stood looking at me. \\u201cThen don\\u2019t you think he can be made to?\\u201d \\u201cIn what way?\\u201d \\u201cWhy, by his coming down.\\u201d\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I see\\u201d\\u2014Miles, for that matter, was grand, too. He settled to his repast with the charming little \\u201ctable manner\\u201d that, from the day of his arrival, had relieved me of all grossness of admonition. Whatever he had been driven from school for, it was not for ugly feeding. He was\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the subject of the interval just concluded, neither challenge nor hint. I had too much, from this moment, my other ideas. Yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of applying them, the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home to me by the beautiful little presence on which\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"importance of what I had seen by my thus finding myself hesitate to mention it. Scarce anything in the whole history seems to me so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear was one, as I may say, with the instinct of sparing my companion. On the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"how he already, from my at first finding nothing to reply, perceived the advantage he had gained. I was so slow to find anything that he had plenty of time, after a minute, to continue with his suggestive but inconclusive smile: \\u201cYou know, my dear, that for a fellow to\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"prospect struck her as slightly grim. She was young, untried, nervous: it was a vision of serious duties and little company, of really great loneliness. She hesitated\\u2014took a couple of days to consult and consider. But the salary offered much exceeded her modest measure, and on a second interview she\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"wanted to know. \\u201cDid she see anything in the boy\\u2014?\\u201d \\u201cThat wasn\\u2019t right? She never told me.\\u201d I had a scruple, but I overcame it. \\u201cWas she careful\\u2014particular?\\u201d Mrs. Grose appeared to try to be conscientious. \\u201cAbout some things\\u2014yes.\\u201d \\u201cBut not about all?\\u201d Again she considered. \\u201cWell, miss\\u2014she\\u2019s gone. I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"indeed, but she said at the same time: \\u201cPoor woman\\u2014she paid for it!\\u201d \\u201cThen you do know what she died of?\\u201d I asked. \\u201cNo\\u2014I know nothing.

He turned away; that was all I knew. It was not that I didn\\u2019t wait, on this occasion, for more, for I was rooted as deeply as I was shaken. Was there a \\u201csecret\\u201d at Bly\\u2014a mystery\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"we\\u2019ve never in the least known what!\\u201d Mrs. Grose declared. \\u201cFor wickedness. For what else\\u2014when he\\u2019s so clever and beautiful and perfect? Is he stupid? Is he untidy? Is he infirm? Is he ill-natured? He\\u2019s exquisite\\u2014so it can be only that; and that would open up the whole thing. After\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"into clearness, but into a darker obscure, and within a minute there had come to me out of my very pity the appalling alarm of his being perhaps innocent. It was for the instant confounding and bottomless, for if he were innocent, what then on earth was I?

And now her brother has managed it for her.\\u201d Mrs. Grose still stood where she had stopped. \\u201cYou suppose they really talk\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"hand. \\u201cOf what queer business, Miles?\\u201d \\u201cWhy, the way you bring me up. And all the rest!\\u201d I fairly held my breath a minute, and even from my glimmering taper there was light enough to show how he smiled up at me from his pillow. \\u201cWhat do you mean by\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"Grose lugubriously pleaded. \\u201cI don\\u2019t wonder you looked queer,\\u201d I persisted, \\u201cwhen I mentioned to you the letter from his school!\\u201d \\u201cI doubt if I looked as queer as you!\\u201d she retorted with homely force. \\u201cAnd if he was so bad then as that comes to, how is he such\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"had occurred had as yet, for the eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow. To mark, for the house, the high state I cultivated I decreed that my meals with the boy should be served, as we called it, downstairs; so that I had been awaiting him in the ponderous pomp\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"have accounted for a good deal more. I scarce know how to put my story into words that shall be a credible picture of my state of mind; but I was in these days literally able to find a joy in the extraordinary flight of heroism the occasion demanded of\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"as a consequence of his having at the piano, the day before, kept me, in Flora\\u2019s interest, so beguiled and befooled. The stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her confinement and departure, and the change itself was now ushered in by our nonobservance of the regular\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"you so sure of the little gentleman?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure of anything but you. But I have, since last evening, a new hope. I think he wants to give me an opening. I do believe that\\u2014poor little exquisite wretch!\\u2014he wants to speak. Last evening, in the firelight and the silence,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"last time, with Mrs. Grose only as an effect of our consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity. In spite of this timidity\\u2014which the child herself, in the oddest way in the world, had been perfectly frank and brave about, allowing it, without a sign of uncomfortable consciousness,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"part of the flattery of his trust of me; for the way in which a man pays his highest tribute to a woman is apt to be but by the more festal celebration of one of the sacred laws of his comfort; and I held that I carried out the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"happy and highly distinguished sinecure. I forget what I was on the present occasion; I only remember that I was something very important and very quiet and that Flora was playing very hard. We were on the edge of the lake, and, as we had lately begun geography, the lake\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"finally said was: \\u201cDo you mean now\\u2014here?\\u201d \\u201cThere couldn\\u2019t be a better place or time.\\u201d He looked round him uneasily, and I had the rare\\u2014oh, the queer!\\u2014impression of the very first symptom I had seen in him of the approach of immediate fear. It was as if he were suddenly\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"would presently like me. It was part of what I already liked Mrs. Grose herself for, the pleasure I could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as I sat at supper with four tall candles and with my pupil, in a high chair and a bib, brightly facing\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"brought me to my feet and straight, in the darkness, to her bed, which I found she had left. A glance at the window enlightened me further, and the striking of a match completed the picture. The child had again got up\\u2014this time blowing out the taper, and had again,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"when they loomed through the dusk, by the grandeur of their actual battlements; yet it was not at such an elevation that the figure I had so often invoked seemed most in place. It produced in me, this figure, in the clear twilight, I remember, two distinct gasps of emotion,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"would have been, in the conditions, an immense added strain to find myself anxious about hers. At the hour I now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on the terrace, where, with the lapse of the season, the afternoon sun was now agreeable; and we sat there together\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"man; impudent, assured, spoiled, depraved. \\u201cThe fellow was a hound.\\u201d Mrs. Grose considered as if it were perhaps a little a case for a sense of shades. \\u201cI\\u2019ve never seen one like him. He did what he wished.\\u201d \\u201cWith her?\\u201d \\u201cWith them all.\\u201d It was as if now in my\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"hour. There was no ambiguity in anything; none whatever, at least, in the conviction I from one moment to another found myself forming as to what I should see straight before me and across the lake as a consequence of raising my eyes. They were attached at this juncture to\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"element so dire? No, no: it was useless to attempt to convey to Mrs. Grose, just as it is scarcely less so to attempt to suggest here, how, in our short, stiff brush in the dark, he fairly shook me with admiration. I was of course thoroughly kind and merciful;\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"on earth was I? Paralyzed, while it lasted, by the mere brush of the question, I let him go a little, so that, with a deep-drawn sigh, he turned away from me again; which, as he faced toward the clear window, I suffered, feeling that I had nothing now there\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"or louder strum of the piano. Then it was that the others, the outsiders, were there. Though they were not angels, they \\u201cpassed,\\u201d as the French say, causing me, while they stayed, to tremble with the fear of their addressing to their younger victims some yet more infernal message or\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"relief at her exemption\\u2014a sense, touching to me even then, that she would have backed me up if she could. I might well have needed that, for with this hard blow of the proof that her eyes were hopelessly sealed I felt my own situation horribly crumble, I felt\\u2014I saw\\u2014my\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"timidity. In spite of this timidity\\u2014which the child herself, in the oddest way in the world, had been perfectly frank and brave about, allowing it, without a sign of uncomfortable consciousness, with the deep, sweet serenity indeed of one of Raphael\\u2019s holy infants, to be discussed, to be imputed to\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"even of a messenger, a postman, or a tradesman\\u2019s boy, from the village. That reminder had as little effect on my practical certitude as I was conscious\\u2014still even without looking\\u2014of its having upon the character and attitude of our visitor. Nothing was more natural than that these things should be\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"still gravity, an expression absolutely new and unprecedented and that appeared to read and accuse and judge me\\u2014this was a stroke that somehow converted the little girl herself into the very presence that could make me quail. I quailed even though my certitude that she thoroughly saw was never greater\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"what else could be done?\\u2014and who, as the holidays were about to begin, would be back from one day to the other. There had been for the two children at first a young lady whom they had had the misfortune to lose. She had done for them quite beautifully\\u2014she was\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"some of the company he kept. All the same, I pressed my interlocutress. \\u201cI promise you I would have told!\\u201d She felt my discrimination. \\u201cI daresay I was wrong. But, really, I was afraid.\\u201d \\u201cAfraid of what?\\u201d \\u201cOf things that man could do.

Still,\\u201d I mused, \\u201cThey must do, for they make me feel more than ever that I must watch.\\u201d It made me blush, the next minute, to see in my friend\\u2019s face how much more unreservedly she had forgiven him than her anecdote\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"mattered? That was the question I used to put to my scrappy retirements. I was dazzled by their loveliness. There was a Sunday\\u2014to get on\\u2014when it rained with such force and for so many hours that there could be no procession to church; in consequence of which, as the day\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"were to keep our heads if we should keep nothing else\\u2014difficult indeed as that might be in the face of what, in our prodigious experience, was least to be questioned.

It had neither bad name nor ill fame, and Mrs. Grose, most apparently, only desired to cling to me and to quake in silence. I even put her, the very last thing of all, to the test.\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"in this agitation, certainly suffered some delay; I reflected that my first duty was, by the gentlest arts I could contrive, to win the child into the sense of knowing me. I spent the day with her out-of-doors; I arranged with her, to her great satisfaction, that it should be\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"ready for more. Then I again shifted my eyes\\u2014I faced what I had to face. I got hold of Mrs. Grose as soon after this as I could; and I can give no intelligible account of how I fought out the interval. Yet I still hear myself cry as I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"rate his freedom now; I was never to touch it again; as I had amply shown, moreover, when, on his joining me in the schoolroom the previous night, I had uttered, on the subject of the interval just concluded, neither challenge nor hint. I had too much, from this moment,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"was someone on the stair. I speak of sequences, but I required no lapse of seconds to stiffen myself for a third encounter with Quint. The apparition had reached the landing halfway up and was therefore on the spot nearest the window, where at sight of me, it stopped short\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"my candle high, till I came within sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn of the staircase. At this point I precipitately found myself aware of three things. They were practically simultaneous, yet they had flashes of succession. My candle, under a bold flourish, went out,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"an advantage\\u2014for it contained only the bare demand for an interview\\u2014that he is already much ashamed of having gone so far for so little, and that what he had on his mind last evening was precisely the need of confession.\\u201d I seemed to myself, for the instant, to have mastered\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"don\\u2019t mean that they had their tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar, for that was not one of their dangers: I do mean, on the other hand, that the element of the unnamed and untouched became, between us, greater than any other, and that so much avoidance could\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"was something between them.\\u201d \\u201cThere was everything.\\u201d \\u201cIn spite of the difference\\u2014?\\u201d \\u201cOh, of their rank, their condition\\u201d\\u2014she brought it woefully out. \\u201cShe was a lady.\\u201d I turned it over; I again saw. \\u201cYes\\u2014she was a lady.\\u201d \\u201cAnd he so dreadfully below,\\u201d said Mrs. Grose. I felt that I doubtless\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"my chair closer: I was conscious of a mortal coldness and felt as if I should never again be warm. So, when he appeared, I was sitting in the glow with my thoughts. He paused a moment by the door as if to look at me; then\\u2014as if to share\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"side of the hearth and sank into a chair.

Here\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"moment when I believed I recognized, faint and far, the cry of a child; there had been another when I found myself just consciously starting as at the passage, before my door, of a light footstep.

It was practically the end of everything. I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"had been perpetually together. It was in fact the very appropriate truth that she had ventured to criticize the propriety, to hint at the incongruity, of so close an alliance, and even to go so far on the subject as a frank overture to Miss Jessel.

It was not so much\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"befall me, the exposure of my society struck her as her least danger.

Finally I went out, taking a candle; I crossed\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"even the impression that, in the past, when you had, without my aid, to flounder about in silence, most of all made you miserable. But I shall get it out of you yet!

So he had everything to say.
