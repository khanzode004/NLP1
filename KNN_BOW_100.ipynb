Shocking murder of an M.P.\\u201d That was the funeral oration of one friend and client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It was, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and self-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for advice. It was not to be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it might be fished for. Presently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest, his head clerk,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"creature was astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his two important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with directions that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he sat all day over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before his eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the corner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"which stood within ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; my evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde.

The movement was thus wholly toward the worse. Even at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of a life of study. I\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God, no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was to fall. Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"no postmark. The note was handed in.\\u201d \\u201cShall I keep this and sleep upon it?\\u201d asked Utterson. \\u201cI wish you to judge for me entirely,\\u201d was the reply. \\u201cI have lost confidence in myself.\\u201d \\u201cWell, I shall consider,\\u201d returned the lawyer. \\u201cAnd now one word more: it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that disappearance?\\u201d The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth tight and nodded. \\u201cI knew it,\\u201d said Utterson. \\u201cHe meant to murder you.

We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end of London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I had never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as I have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his face, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and great apparent debility of constitution, and\\u2014last but not least\\u2014with the odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore some resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked sinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic, personal distaste, and merely wondered at\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook himself to Dr. Lanyon\\u2019s. There at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor\\u2019s appearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The rosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly balder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift physical decay that arrested the lawyer\\u2019s notice, as a look in the eye and quality of manner that seemed\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"learned to dwell with pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of these elements. If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that these\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"as old and commonplace as man; much the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with so vast a majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to keep to it. Yes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by friends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to the liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses and secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde. I made\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"Hyde. If he could but once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined. He might see a reason for his friend\\u2019s strange preference or bondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of the will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred.\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"of my intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth, by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my part, from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of effort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much less exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde was so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; my evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde.

I would still be\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"the prospect had smiled with every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment, friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were wrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but in view of Lanyon\\u2019s manner and words, there must lie for it some deeper ground. A week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less than a fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which he had been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room, and sitting there\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"been much less exercised and much less exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde was so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as good shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the glass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome.\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil. I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive experiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I once more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs of dissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the stature and the face of Henry Jekyll. That night I had come to\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"\\u201cWho is going to do it?\\u201d \\u201cWhy, you and me, sir,\\u201d was the undaunted reply. \\u201cThat\\u2019s very well said,\\u201d returned the lawyer; \\u201cand whatever comes of it, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser.\\u201d \\u201cThere is an axe in the theatre,\\u201d continued Poole; \\u201cand you might take the kitchen poker for yourself.\\u201d The lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and balanced it. \\u201cDo you know, Poole,\\u201d he said, looking up, \\u201cthat you and I are about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?\\u201d \\u201cYou may say so, sir, indeed,\\u201d\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"impressed his beholders. It was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr. Jekyll\\u2019s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden, to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or dissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of the garden.

No, sir; master\\u2019s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we heard him cry out upon the name of God; and who\\u2019s in there instead of him, and why it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr. Utterson!\\u201d \\u201cThis is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my man,\\u201d said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. \\u201cSuppose it were as you suppose, supposing Dr. Jekyll\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"all of a sudden he broke out in a great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, brandishing the cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like a madman.

The less I understood of this farrago, the less I was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to Jekyll\\u2019s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my members. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth, by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that point. Others will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines; and I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently judged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went, were crying themselves hoarse along the footways: \\u201cSpecial edition. Shocking murder of an M.P.\\u201d That was the funeral oration of one friend and client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It was, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and self-reliant as he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for advice. It was not\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against him, and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of a different order. His terror of the gallows drove him continually to commit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a part instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the despondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented the dislike with which he was himself regarded. Hence the ape-like tricks that he would play\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"balderdash,\\u201d added the doctor, flushing suddenly purple, \\u201cwould have estranged Damon and Pythias.\\u201d This little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson. \\u201cThey have only differed on some point of science,\\u201d he thought; and being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of conveyancing), he even added: \\u201cIt is nothing worse than that!\\u201d He gave his friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached the question he had come to put. \\u201cDid you ever come across a prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 of his\\u2014one Hyde?\\u201d he asked. \\u201cHyde?\\u201d repeated Lanyon. \\u201cNo. Never heard of\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes. \\u201cI do not care to hear more,\\u201d said he. \\u201cThis is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.\\u201d \\u201cWhat I heard was abominable,\\u201d said Utterson. \\u201cIt can make no change. You do not understand my position,\\u201d returned the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. \\u201cI am painfully situated, Utterson; my position is a very strange\\u2014a very strange one. It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.\\u201d \\u201cJekyll,\\u201d said Utterson, \\u201cyou know me:\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"as well we have met; and \\u00e0 propos, you should have my address.\\u201d And he gave a number of a street in Soho. \\u201cGood God!\\u201d thought Mr. Utterson, \\u201ccan he, too, have been thinking of the will?\\u201d But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address. \\u201cAnd now,\\u201d said the other, \\u201chow did you know me?\\u201d \\u201cBy description,\\u201d was the reply. \\u201cWhose description?\\u201d \\u201cWe have common friends,\\u201d said Mr. Utterson. \\u201cCommon friends,\\u201d echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. \\u201cWho are they?\\u201d \\u201cJekyll, for instance,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cHe never told you,\\u201d cried Mr. Hyde,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"of musing. From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: \\u201cAnd you don\\u2019t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?\\u201d \\u201cA likely place, isn\\u2019t it?\\u201d returned Mr. Enfield. \\u201cBut I happen to have noticed his address; he lives in some square or other.\\u201d \\u201cAnd you never asked about the\\u2014place with the door?\\u201d said Mr. Utterson. \\u201cNo, sir; I had a delicacy,\\u201d was the reply. \\u201cI feel very strongly about putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment. You start a question, and it\\u2019s like starting a stone. You sit\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"near along the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small gentleman, to whom at first she paid less attention. When they had come within speech (which was just under the maid\\u2019s eyes) the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness. It did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great importance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he were only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"night however, was far gone into the morning\\u2014the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the conception of the day\\u2014the inmates of my house were locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom.

It will not last long, thank God.\\u201d \\u201cYou stay too much indoors,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cYou should be out, whipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is my cousin\\u2014Mr. Enfield\\u2014Dr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a quick turn with us.\\u201d \\u201cYou are very good,\\u201d sighed the other. \\u201cI should like to very much; but no, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson, I am very glad to see you; this is\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"recall the abjection and passion of this attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him. It is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this description; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice; and yet even to these, habit brought\\u2014no, not alleviation\\u2014but a certain callousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my punishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity which has now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I became, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one thought: the horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when the virtue of the medicine wore off, I would leap almost without transition\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"salads, many ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning glass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part, as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings. This was the home of Henry Jekyll\\u2019s favourite; of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling. An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had an evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes, she said, this was Mr. Hyde\\u2019s, but\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"and I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere polity of multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my part, from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction and in one direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own person, that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality of man; I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my consciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only because I was radically both; and from an\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"heart in your ears, Mr. Utterson, and tell me, is that the doctor\\u2019s foot?\\u201d The steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they went so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread of Henry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. \\u201cIs there never anything else?\\u201d he asked. Poole nodded. \\u201cOnce,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOnce I heard it weeping!\\u201d \\u201cWeeping? how that?\\u201d said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of horror. \\u201cWeeping like a woman or a lost soul,\\u201d said the butler. \\u201cI came away with that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.\\u201d But\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was co-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which in themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish but inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned; that what was dead, and had no shape, should usurp the offices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to him closer than\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"the bones, deadly nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour of birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and I came to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something strange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its very novelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in body; within I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of disordered sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent freedom of\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But there it is; quite in your way: a murderer\\u2019s autograph.\\u201d Guest\\u2019s eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with passion. \\u201cNo sir,\\u201d he said: \\u201cnot mad; but it is an odd hand.\\u201d \\u201cAnd by all accounts a very odd writer,\\u201d added the lawyer. Just then the servant entered with a note. \\u201cIs that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?\\u201d inquired the clerk. \\u201cI thought I knew the writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?\\u201d \\u201cOnly an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?\\u201d \\u201cOne moment.\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"night under the face of the fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post. \\u201cIf he be Mr. Hyde,\\u201d he had thought, \\u201cI shall be Mr. Seek.\\u201d And at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost in the air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken by any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By ten o\\u2019clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"I am at a loss whether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in your hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so great a trust in you.\\u201d \\u201cYou fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?\\u201d asked the lawyer. \\u201cNo,\\u201d said the other. \\u201cI cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I am quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this hateful business has rather exposed.\\u201d Utterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend\\u2019s selfishness, and yet relieved by\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"am no longer here.\\u201d Utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. \\u201cWell,\\u201d said he, \\u201cI promise.\\u201d Nearly a year later, in the month of October, 18\\u2014, London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone upstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane, which the maid\\u2019s window overlooked, was\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"of Dr. Jekyll,\\u201d he said in a loud, unsteady voice. \\u201cI am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any allusion to one whom I regard as dead.\\u201d \\u201cTut, tut!\\u201d said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause, \\u201cCan\\u2019t I do anything?\\u201d he inquired. \\u201cWe are three very old friends, Lanyon; we shall not live to make others.\\u201d \\u201cNothing can be done,\\u201d returned Lanyon; \\u201cask himself.\\u201d \\u201cHe will not see me,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cI am not surprised at that,\\u201d was the reply. \\u201cSome day, Utterson, after I am dead, you may perhaps\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be preferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to ask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own hand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from my cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude completely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation, you will have understood that these arrangements are\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"of his private safe. It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may be doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his surviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but his thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart, he preferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into that house of voluntary bondage, and to\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"said the lawyer. \\u201cNow, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.\\u201d \\u201cYou know the doctor\\u2019s ways, sir,\\u201d replied Poole, \\u201cand how he shuts himself up. Well, he\\u2019s shut up again in the cabinet; and I don\\u2019t like it, sir\\u2014I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I\\u2019m afraid.\\u201d \\u201cNow, my good man,\\u201d said the lawyer, \\u201cbe explicit. What are you afraid of?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ve been afraid for about a week,\\u201d returned Poole, doggedly disregarding the question, \\u201cand I can bear it no more.\\u201d The man\\u2019s appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"seen the last of Henry Jekyll.\\u201d Upon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane; but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound to do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less I was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to Jekyll\\u2019s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by the same post as mine\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness and circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from the action of his ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing on us both has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now, when I shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I know how I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, with the most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and down this room (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"of moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the transforming draught. I do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his vice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that he runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I, long as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the complete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which were the leading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I was punished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was conscious, even\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"premonitory shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I became, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely occupied by one thought: the horror of my other self. But when I slept, or when the virtue of the medicine wore off, I would\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"running like a millrace in my fancy, a solution of the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul. I knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my original evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and delighted me like wine. I stretched out my hands, exulting in the freshness of these sensations; and in the act, I was suddenly aware that I had lost in stature. There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"of what you describe,\\u201d said Mr. Utterson. \\u201cQuite so, sir,\\u201d returned Poole. \\u201cWell, when that masked thing like a monkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it went down my spine like ice. O, I know it\\u2019s not evidence, Mr. Utterson; I\\u2019m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I give you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!\\u201d \\u201cAy, ay,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cMy fears incline to the same point. Evil, I fear, founded\\u2014evil was sure to come\\u2014of that connection.

The old gentleman took a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle hurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to the earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted. It was two o\\u2019clock when she came to\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"had begun to suggest the most naked possibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with pleasure, as a beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of these elements. If each, I told myself, could be housed in separate identities, life would be relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust might go his way, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward path, doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"were of the gloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive, he was conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law\\u2019s officers, which may at times assail the most honest. As the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many women of many different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By ten o\\u2019clock, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long grown\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"who was Jekyll\\u2019s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance. Nowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive. Poole stamped on the flags of the corridor. \\u201cHe must be buried here,\\u201d he said, hearkening to the sound. \\u201cOr he may have fled,\\u201d said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door in the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they found the key, already stained\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"that was never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"saying not that which I know, but that which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature, to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust and less developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in the course of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of effort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much less exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde was so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as good shone\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"business room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll\\u2019s Will and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for Mr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided not only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands of his \\u201cfriend and benefactor Edward Hyde,\\u201d\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"thus bound together\\u2014that in the agonised womb of consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling. How, then were they dissociated? I was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling immateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body in which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to shake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss the curtains\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"pass into the hands of his \\u201cfriend and benefactor Edward Hyde,\\u201d but that in case of Dr. Jekyll\\u2019s \\u201cdisappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months,\\u201d the said Edward Hyde should step into the said Henry Jekyll\\u2019s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the doctor\\u2019s household. This document had long been the lawyer\\u2019s eyesore. It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest.\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"received by me in secret? The more I reflected the more convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral disease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old revolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence. Twelve o\\u2019clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded very gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a small man crouching against the pillars of the portico. \\u201cAre you come from Dr. Jekyll?\\u201d I asked. He told me \\u201cyes\\u201d by a constrained gesture; and when\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"furnished with costly cabinets of oak. \\u201cWill you wait here by the fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?\\u201d \\u201cHere, thank you,\\u201d said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the tall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy of his friend the doctor\\u2019s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of it as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"things, with a cheval-glass and a business table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. He did not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice. \\u201cAnd now,\\u201d said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, \\u201cyou have heard the news?\\u201d The\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"clear of this accursed topic, then in God\\u2019s name, go, for I cannot bear it.\\u201d As soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll, complaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of this unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long answer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious in drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. \\u201cI do not blame our old friend,\\u201d Jekyll wrote, \\u201cbut I share his view that we must never meet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion;\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was the lawyer\\u2019s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the well-known\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I thought, a change\\u2014he seemed to swell\\u2014his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alter\\u2014and the next moment, I had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to shield me from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror. \\u201cO God!\\u201d I screamed, and \\u201cO God!\\u201d again and again; for there before my eyes\\u2014pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with his hands, like a man restored from death\\u2014there stood Henry Jekyll! What he told\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on, Mr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to grow more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his way of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde. Now that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for Dr. Jekyll. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his friends, became once more their familiar guest and entertainer; and whilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less distinguished for\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"was dealing with a case of cerebral disease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old revolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence. Twelve o\\u2019clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded very gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a small man crouching against the pillars of the portico. \\u201cAre you come from Dr. Jekyll?\\u201d I asked. He told me \\u201cyes\\u201d by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him enter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"have been thinking of the will?\\u201d But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address. \\u201cAnd now,\\u201d said the other, \\u201chow did you know me?\\u201d \\u201cBy description,\\u201d was the reply. \\u201cWhose description?\\u201d \\u201cWe have common friends,\\u201d said Mr. Utterson. \\u201cCommon friends,\\u201d echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. \\u201cWho are they?\\u201d \\u201cJekyll, for instance,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cHe never told you,\\u201d cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. \\u201cI did not think you would have lied.\\u201d \\u201cCome,\\u201d said Mr. Utterson, \\u201cthat is not fitting language.\\u201d The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"like my neighbours; and then I smiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will with the lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that vainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the most deadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then as in its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in the temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger, a solution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung formlessly on my shrunken limbs; the\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"\\u201cthere\\u2019s a rather singular resemblance; the two hands are in many points identical: only differently sloped.\\u201d \\u201cRather quaint,\\u201d said Utterson. \\u201cIt is, as you say, rather quaint,\\u201d returned Guest. \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t speak of this note, you know,\\u201d said the master. \\u201cNo, sir,\\u201d said the clerk. \\u201cI understand.\\u201d But no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the note into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. \\u201cWhat!\\u201d he thought. \\u201cHenry Jekyll forge for a murderer!\\u201d And his blood ran cold in his veins. Time ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"things, sir,\\u201d whispered Poole. \\u201cAnd surely none stranger than itself,\\u201d echoed the lawyer in the same tones. \\u201cFor what did Jekyll\\u201d\\u2014he caught himself up at the word with a start, and then conquering the weakness\\u2014\\u201cwhat could Jekyll want with it?\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou may say that!\\u201d said Poole. Next they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctor\\u2019s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and several enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in the same\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"of a more unbridled, a more furious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God, no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us continues to walk\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"offered in reward, for the death of Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde had disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never existed. Much of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable: tales came out of the man\\u2019s cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of his vile life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to have surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a whisper. From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of the murder, he was\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"me the anger of a passer-by, whom I recognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and the child\\u2019s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my life; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward Hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in the name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edward Hyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"which he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a father\\u2019s interest; Hyde had more than a son\\u2019s indifference. To cast in my lot with Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly indulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a blow and forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear unequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for while Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde would be\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"first floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they\\u2019re clean. And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must live there. And yet it\\u2019s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed together about the court, that it\\u2019s hard to say where one ends and another begins.\\u201d The pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then \\u201cEnfield,\\u201d said Mr. Utterson, \\u201cthat\\u2019s a good rule of yours.\\u201d \\u201cYes, I think it is,\\u201d returned Enfield. \\u201cBut for all that,\\u201d continued the lawyer, \\u201cthere\\u2019s one point I want to ask. I want to\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"of knowledge or the relief of sorrow and suffering. And it chanced that the direction of my scientific studies, which led wholly towards the mystic and the transcendental, reacted and shed a strong light on this consciousness of the perennial war among my members. With every day, and from both sides of my intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth, by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I say two, because the state of my own knowledge does\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"that their way led them down a by-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The inhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in contrast to\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"14th, the door was shut against the lawyer. \\u201cThe doctor was confined to the house,\\u201d Poole said, \\u201cand saw no one.\\u201d On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and having now been used for the last two months to see his friend almost daily, he found this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The fifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook himself to Dr. Lanyon\\u2019s. There at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he was shocked at the change which had taken\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"least, before God, no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was to fall. Instantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport of glee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"will perhaps not wonder that I hear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I have gone too far in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end.\\u201d \\u201cIt is well,\\u201d replied my visitor. \\u201cLanyon, you remember your vows: what follows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who have so long been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who have denied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided your superiors\\u2014behold!\\u201d He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed;\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of which I chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical enough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could not conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of devilish fury; and the smile withered from his face\\u2014happily for him\\u2014yet more happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged him from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they exchange\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"help; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite safe; mark my words, he will never more be heard of.\\u201d The lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend\\u2019s feverish manner. \\u201cYou seem pretty sure of him,\\u201d said he; \\u201cand for your sake, I hope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear.\\u201d \\u201cI am quite sure of him,\\u201d replied Jekyll; \\u201cI have grounds for certainty that I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you may advise me. I have\\u2014I have\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"and sordid negligence. The door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages. Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and pointed. \\u201cDid you ever remark that door?\\u201d he\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"\\u201cI don\\u2019t ask that,\\u201d pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other\\u2019s arm; \\u201cI only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake, when I am no longer here.\\u201d Utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. \\u201cWell,\\u201d said he, \\u201cI promise.\\u201d Nearly a year later, in the month of October, 18\\u2014, London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone upstairs to bed\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"that a man does not, in real life, walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with another man\\u2019s cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and sneering. \\u2018Set your mind at rest,\\u2019 says he, \\u2018I will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself.\\u2019 So we all set off, the doctor, and the child\\u2019s father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"he tossed to and fro, until the small hours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and besieged by questions. Six o\\u2019clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently near to Mr. Utterson\\u2019s dwelling, and still he was digging at the problem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room, Mr. Enfield\\u2019s\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"side. With Jekyll, it was a thing of vital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creature that shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was co-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which in themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish but inorganic. This was the shocking thing; that the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices; that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned; that what was dead,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"\\u201cWell,\\u201d said he, \\u201cI promise.\\u201d Nearly a year later, in the month of October, 18\\u2014, London was startled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A maid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone upstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane, which the maid\\u2019s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the full moon. It seems she\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but even resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them uninterrupted. It chanced on one of these\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"steps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door. \\u201cMr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you,\\u201d he called; and even as he did so, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear. A voice answered from within: \\u201cTell him I cannot see anyone,\\u201d it said complainingly. \\u201cThank you, sir,\\u201d said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in his voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across the yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the beetles were leaping on the\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"Mr. Utterson.\\u201d And the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. \\u201cPoor Harry Jekyll,\\u201d he thought, \\u201cmy mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was wild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of God, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming, pede claudo, years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the fault.\\u201d And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded awhile on his own past, groping in all\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I thought, a change\\u2014he seemed to swell\\u2014his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alter\\u2014and the next moment, I had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to shield me from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror. \\u201cO God!\\u201d I screamed, and \\u201cO God!\\u201d again and again; for there before my eyes\\u2014pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with his hands, like a\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"returned Mr. Enfield: \\u201cI was coming home from some place at the end of the world, about three o\\u2019clock of a black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the folks asleep\\u2014street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church\\u2014till at last I got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman. All at once, I saw two figures:\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"then that we should be frank,\\u201d said the other. \\u201cWe both think more than we have said; let us make a clean breast. This masked figure that you saw, did you recognise it?\\u201d \\u201cWell, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that I could hardly swear to that,\\u201d was the answer. \\u201cBut if you mean, was it Mr. Hyde?\\u2014why, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the same bigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who else could have got in by the laboratory door?\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all hours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which I now condemned myself, ay, even beyond what I had thought possible to man, I became, in my own person, a creature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and mind, and solely\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"neatly enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so that it was plain they were of Jekyll\\u2019s private manufacture; and when I opened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple crystalline salt of a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned my attention, might have been about half full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to contain phosphorus and some volatile ether. At the other ingredients I could make no guess. The book was an ordinary version\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God, no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything. But I had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us continues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations; and in my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was to fall.\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"sombre excitement. \\u201cHave you got it?\\u201d he cried. \\u201cHave you got it?\\u201d And so lively was his impatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake me. I put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my blood. \\u201cCome, sir,\\u201d said I. \\u201cYou forget that I have not yet the pleasure of your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.\\u201d And I showed him an example, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness of\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"and called for the police. The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle of the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been done, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter\\u2014the other, without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a sealed and stamped envelope, which he\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"with another man\\u2019s cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and sneering. \\u2018Set your mind at rest,\\u2019 says he, \\u2018I will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself.\\u2019 So we all set off, the doctor, and the child\\u2019s father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself, and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"long before I put this theory to the test of practice. I knew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled and shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of an overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition, utterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to change. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at last overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my tincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a large quantity\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"the thing; for the man trampled calmly over the child\\u2019s body and left her screaming on the ground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn\\u2019t like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa, took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had turned out were\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who was much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the floor, with their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and on the hearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had been burned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end of a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the other half of the stick\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"from the by-street, there was a square of ancient, handsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men; map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for the fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly servant opened the door. \\u201cIs Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?\\u201d asked\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and sneering. \\u2018Set your mind at rest,\\u2019 says he, \\u2018I will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself.\\u2019 So we all set off, the doctor, and the child\\u2019s father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself, and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat looking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be re-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a great effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation of the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all hours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory shudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it was always as Hyde that I awakened. Under\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"furious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that stirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to the civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God, no man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a provocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything.

You had a fine escape.\\u201d \\u201cI have had what is far more to the purpose,\\u201d returned the doctor solemnly: \\u201cI have had a lesson\\u2014O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have had!\\u201d And he covered his\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"\\u201cThey have only differed on some point of science,\\u201d he thought; and being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of conveyancing), he even added: \\u201cIt is nothing worse than that!\\u201d He gave his friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached the question he had come to put. \\u201cDid you ever come across a prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 of his\\u2014one Hyde?\\u201d he asked. \\u201cHyde?\\u201d repeated Lanyon. \\u201cNo. Never heard of him. Since my time.\\u201d That was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. \\u201cI do not blame our old friend,\\u201d Jekyll wrote, \\u201cbut I share his view that we must never meet. I mean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you must not be surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is often shut even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I have brought on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could not think that this\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"broken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and one splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter\\u2014the other, without doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold watch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a sealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the post, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson. This was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of bed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than he\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"there were moments when I feared for my life; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward Hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in the name of Henry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edward Hyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied my double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate. Some two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"\\u00e0 propos, you should have my address.\\u201d And he gave a number of a street in Soho. \\u201cGood God!\\u201d thought Mr. Utterson, \\u201ccan he, too, have been thinking of the will?\\u201d But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address. \\u201cAnd now,\\u201d said the other, \\u201chow did you know me?\\u201d \\u201cBy description,\\u201d was the reply. \\u201cWhose description?\\u201d \\u201cWe have common friends,\\u201d said Mr. Utterson. \\u201cCommon friends,\\u201d echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. \\u201cWho are they?\\u201d \\u201cJekyll, for instance,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cHe never told you,\\u201d cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. \\u201cI\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"his pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous evil. It was the curse of mankind that these incongruous faggots were thus bound together\\u2014that in the agonised womb of consciousness, these polar twins should be continuously struggling. How, then were they dissociated? I was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to perceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling immateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body in\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"mind. \\u201cI suppose, Lanyon,\\u201d said he, \\u201cyou and I must be the two oldest friends that Henry Jekyll has?\\u201d \\u201cI wish the friends were younger,\\u201d chuckled Dr. Lanyon. \\u201cBut I suppose we are. And what of that? I see little of him now.\\u201d \\u201cIndeed?\\u201d said Utterson. \\u201cI thought you had a bond of common interest.\\u201d \\u201cWe had,\\u201d was the reply. \\u201cBut it is more than ten years since Henry Jekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind; and though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old sake\\u2019s sake, as\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"man,\\u201d said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. \\u201cSuppose it were as you suppose, supposing Dr. Jekyll to have been\\u2014well, murdered, what could induce the murderer to stay? That won\\u2019t hold water; it doesn\\u2019t commend itself to reason.\\u201d \\u201cWell, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I\\u2019ll do it yet,\\u201d said Poole. \\u201cAll this last week (you must know) him, or it, whatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and day for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was sometimes his way\\u2014the master\\u2019s, that is\\u2014to write his\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"to speak of it as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently returned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out. \\u201cI saw Mr. Hyde go in by the\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"like a woman or a lost soul,\\u201d said the butler. \\u201cI came away with that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.\\u201d But now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe from under a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest table to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath to where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in the quiet of the night. \\u201cJekyll,\\u201d cried Utterson, with a loud voice, \\u201cI demand to see you.\\u201d He paused a\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"all the corners of memory, least by chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light there. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided. And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of hope. \\u201cThis Master Hyde, if he were studied,\\u201d thought he, \\u201cmust have secrets\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"first sight. So had the child\\u2019s family, which was only natural. But the doctor\\u2019s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones turn sick and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his mind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"burned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end of a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the other half of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched his suspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to the bank, where several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderer\\u2019s credit, completed his gratification. \\u201cYou may depend upon it, sir,\\u201d he told Mr. Utterson: \\u201cI have him in my hand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick or, above all, burned\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"safe, \\u201cand now I begin to fear it is disgrace.\\u201d With that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his friend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding patients. \\u201cIf anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,\\u201d he had thought. The solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage of delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where Dr. Lanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper, red-faced gentleman, with\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"and a closed door, and the very meals left there to be smuggled in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day, ay, and twice and thrice in the same day, there have been orders and complaints, and I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists in town. Every time I brought the stuff back, there would be another paper telling me to return it, because it was not pure, and another order to a different firm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir, whatever for.\\u201d \\u201cHave you any of these papers?\\u201d asked Mr. Utterson. Poole felt in\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"but one thing, Utterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it) will be more than enough. The creature who crept into my house that night was, on Jekyll\\u2019s own confession, known by the name of Hyde and hunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of Carew. I was born in the year 18\\u2014 to a large fortune, endowed besides with excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect of the wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"secret? The more I reflected the more convinced I grew that I was dealing with a case of cerebral disease; and though I dismissed my servants to bed, I loaded an old revolver, that I might be found in some posture of self-defence. Twelve o\\u2019clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded very gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a small man crouching against the pillars of the portico. \\u201cAre you come from Dr. Jekyll?\\u201d I asked. He told me \\u201cyes\\u201d by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"hope not,\\u201d said Utterson. \\u201cDid I ever tell you that I once saw him, and shared your feeling of repulsion?\\u201d \\u201cIt was impossible to do the one without the other,\\u201d returned Enfield. \\u201cAnd by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that this was a back way to Dr. Jekyll\\u2019s! It was partly your own fault that I found it out, even when I did.\\u201d \\u201cSo you found it out, did you?\\u201d said Utterson. \\u201cBut if that be so, we may step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they went so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread of Henry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. \\u201cIs there never anything else?\\u201d he asked. Poole nodded. \\u201cOnce,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOnce I heard it weeping!\\u201d \\u201cWeeping? how that?\\u201d said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of horror. \\u201cWeeping like a woman or a lost soul,\\u201d said the butler. \\u201cI came away with that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.\\u201d But now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe from under a stack of\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet. It was but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my head like quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon his face? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run from me? I have served him long enough. And then...\\u201d The man paused and passed his hand over his face. \\u201cThese are all very strange circumstances,\\u201d said Mr. Utterson, \\u201cbut I think I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand of it; I can\\u2019t describe him. And it\\u2019s not want of memory; for I declare I can see him this moment.\\u201d Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration. \\u201cYou are sure he used a key?\\u201d he inquired at last. \\u201cMy dear sir...\\u201d began Enfield, surprised out of himself. \\u201cYes, I know,\\u201d said Utterson; \\u201cI know it must seem strange. The fact is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I know it already.\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end of London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such hateful faces; and there\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"sir, and he threw it back to me like so much dirt,\\u201d returned Poole. \\u201cThis is unquestionably the doctor\\u2019s hand, do you know?\\u201d resumed the lawyer. \\u201cI thought it looked like it,\\u201d said the servant rather sulkily; and then, with another voice, \\u201cBut what matters hand of write?\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve seen him!\\u201d \\u201cSeen him?\\u201d repeated Mr. Utterson. \\u201cWell?\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s it!\\u201d said Poole. \\u201cIt was this way. I came suddenly into the theatre from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this drug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"own thoughts or see his own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must I delay too long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has hitherto escaped destruction, it has been by a combination of great prudence and great good luck. Should the throes of change take me in the act of writing it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time shall have elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness and circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from the action of his ape-like\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes, she said, this was Mr. Hyde\\u2019s, but he was not at home; he had been in that night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour; there was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and he was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she had seen him till yesterday. \\u201cVery well, then, we wish to see his rooms,\\u201d said the lawyer; and when the woman began to declare it was impossible, \\u201cI had better tell you who this person is,\\u201d\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"And then with an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind that the servants were already used to the coming and going of my second self. I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of my own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange array; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape and was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of breakfasting. Small indeed was\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor\\u2019s appearance. He had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The rosy man had grown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly balder and older; and yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift physical decay that arrested the lawyer\\u2019s notice, as a look in the eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror of the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet that was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. \\u201cYes,\\u201d he thought;\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"I am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I cannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me of other things, for God\\u2019s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep clear of this accursed topic, then in God\\u2019s name, go, for I cannot bear it.\\u201d As soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll, complaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of this unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long answer,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"Many a man would have even blazoned such irregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high views that I had set before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost morbid sense of shame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my aspirations than any particular degradation in my faults, that made me what I was, and, with even a deeper trench than in the majority of men, severed in me those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound man\\u2019s dual nature. In this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone upstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane, which the maid\\u2019s window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the full moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon her box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a dream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she narrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with all men\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"my left hand to help you. Lanyon, my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you fail me to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface, that I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge for yourself. \\u201cI want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night\\u2014ay, even if you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless your carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in your hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my butler, has\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"note of her lamentation, they had all started and turned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. \\u201cAnd now,\\u201d continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, \\u201creach me a candle, and we\\u2019ll get this through hands at once.\\u201d And then he begged Mr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden. \\u201cNow, sir,\\u201d said he, \\u201cyou come as gently as you can. I want you to hear, and I don\\u2019t want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any chance he was to ask you in, don\\u2019t go.\\u201d Mr. Utterson\\u2019s nerves, at\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"very strange one. It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.\\u201d \\u201cJekyll,\\u201d said Utterson, \\u201cyou know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you out of it.\\u201d \\u201cMy good Utterson,\\u201d said the doctor, \\u201cthis is very good of you, this is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn\\u2019t\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"entry of a court; and just at that point a certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It was two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower storey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore in every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The door, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried his knife on the mouldings;\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"aversions to the dryness of a life of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my pleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well known and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this incoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on this side that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but to drink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to assume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"it!\\u201d And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read as follows: \\u201cMy dear Utterson,\\u2014When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have disappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to foresee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless situation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and first read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your hands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of \\u201cYour unworthy and unhappy friend, \\u201cThere was a third enclosure?\\u201d\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"one lay beside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy of a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great esteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies. Next, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came to the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary horror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"added, \\u201cfind me some of the old.\\u201d \\u201cThis is a strange note,\\u201d said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, \\u201cHow do you come to have it open?\\u201d \\u201cThe man at Maw\\u2019s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like so much dirt,\\u201d returned Poole. \\u201cThis is unquestionably the doctor\\u2019s hand, do you know?\\u201d resumed the lawyer. \\u201cI thought it looked like it,\\u201d said the servant rather sulkily; and then, with another voice, \\u201cBut what matters hand of write?\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve seen him!\\u201d \\u201cSeen him?\\u201d repeated Mr. Utterson. \\u201cWell?\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s it!\\u201d said Poole. \\u201cIt was this way.\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The square, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole, who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all the hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"into my soul. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die away, it was succeeded by a sense of joy. The problem of my conduct was solved. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was now confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced to think of it! with what willing humility I embraced anew the restrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I locked the door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key under my heel! The next day, came the news that\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"God, Utterson, what a lesson I have had!\\u201d And he covered his face for a moment with his hands. On his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole. \\u201cBy the bye,\\u201d said he, \\u201cthere was a letter handed in to-day: what was the messenger like?\\u201d But Poole was positive nothing had come except by post; \\u201cand only circulars by that,\\u201d he added. This news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been written in the cabinet; and if that were\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"by a second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell from their doors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was Jekyll\\u2019s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance.\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"lawyer\\u2019s notice, as a look in the eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror of the mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet that was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. \\u201cYes,\\u201d he thought; \\u201che is a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted; and the knowledge is more than he can bear.\\u201d And yet when Utterson remarked on his ill looks, it was with an air of great firmness that Lanyon declared himself a doomed man. \\u201cI have had a shock,\\u201d he\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"ill?\\u201d \\u201cMr. Utterson,\\u201d said the man, \\u201cthere is something wrong.\\u201d \\u201cTake a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cNow, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.\\u201d \\u201cYou know the doctor\\u2019s ways, sir,\\u201d replied Poole, \\u201cand how he shuts himself up. Well, he\\u2019s shut up again in the cabinet; and I don\\u2019t like it, sir\\u2014I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I\\u2019m afraid.\\u201d \\u201cNow, my good man,\\u201d said the lawyer, \\u201cbe explicit. What are you afraid of?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ve been afraid for about a week,\\u201d returned Poole,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they exchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a private room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his two important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"replied my visitor. \\u201cLanyon, you remember your vows: what follows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who have so long been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who have denied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided your superiors\\u2014behold!\\u201d He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; he reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I thought, a change\\u2014he seemed to swell\\u2014his face became suddenly black and the\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"sit and speak with its inscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to communicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would sometimes even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very silent, he did not read; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. Utterson became so used to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off little by little in the frequency of his visits. It chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr.\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"anyone,\\u201d it said complainingly. \\u201cThank you, sir,\\u201d said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in his voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across the yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the beetles were leaping on the floor. \\u201cSir,\\u201d he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, \\u201cWas that my master\\u2019s voice?\\u201d \\u201cIt seems much changed,\\u201d replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look for look. \\u201cChanged? Well, yes, I think so,\\u201d said the butler. \\u201cHave I been twenty years in this man\\u2019s house, to be deceived about\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"thought of) is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to change their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like Queer Street, the less I ask.\\u201d \\u201cA very good rule, too,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cBut I have studied the place for myself,\\u201d continued Mr. Enfield. \\u201cIt seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my adventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"and had a word or two with Poole. \\u201cBy the bye,\\u201d said he, \\u201cthere was a letter handed in to-day: what was the messenger like?\\u201d But Poole was positive nothing had come except by post; \\u201cand only circulars by that,\\u201d he added. This news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been written in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently judged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went, were crying themselves hoarse along the footways: \\u201cSpecial edition.\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"thought: \\u201cwhat if this should cost me another?\\u201d And then he condemned the fear as a disloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another enclosure, likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as \\u201cnot to be opened till the death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.\\u201d Utterson could not trust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the mad will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again were the idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in the will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"lawyer. \\u201cLet us go back to the cabinet.\\u201d They mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional awestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine the contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been prevented. \\u201cThat is the same drug that I was always bringing him,\\u201d said Poole; and even as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over. This brought them to the\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"you to promise me that you will bear with him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew all; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t pretend that I shall ever like him,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cI don\\u2019t ask that,\\u201d pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other\\u2019s arm; \\u201cI only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake, when I am no longer here.\\u201d Utterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. \\u201cWell,\\u201d said he, \\u201cI promise.\\u201d Nearly a year later, in the month\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"it?\\u201d \\u201cWhy, you and me, sir,\\u201d was the undaunted reply. \\u201cThat\\u2019s very well said,\\u201d returned the lawyer; \\u201cand whatever comes of it, I shall make it my business to see you are no loser.\\u201d \\u201cThere is an axe in the theatre,\\u201d continued Poole; \\u201cand you might take the kitchen poker for yourself.\\u201d The lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and balanced it. \\u201cDo you know, Poole,\\u201d he said, looking up, \\u201cthat you and I are about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?\\u201d \\u201cYou may say so, sir, indeed,\\u201d returned the butler. \\u201cIt is\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"get you out of it.\\u201d \\u201cMy good Utterson,\\u201d said the doctor, \\u201cthis is very good of you, this is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn\\u2019t what you fancy; it is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde. I give you my hand upon that;\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"had no shape, should usurp the offices of life. And this again, that that insurgent horror was knit to him closer than a wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh, where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every hour of weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against him, and deposed him out of life. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of a different order. His terror of the gallows drove him continually to commit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a part instead of\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"added. \\u201cThis is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland Yard.\\u201d A flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman\\u2019s face. \\u201cAh!\\u201d said she, \\u201che is in trouble! What has he done?\\u201d Mr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. \\u201cHe don\\u2019t seem a very popular character,\\u201d observed the latter. \\u201cAnd now, my good woman, just let me and this gentleman have a look about us.\\u201d In the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained otherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these were furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was now confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced to think of it! with what willing humility I embraced anew the restrictions of natural life! with what sincere renunciation I locked the door by which I had so often gone and come, and ground the key under my heel! The next day, came the news that the murder had been overlooked, that the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was a man high in public estimation. It was\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancing with his bull\\u2019s eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor started and made greater haste. These particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed him into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand ready on my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I had never set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as I have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his face, with his\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"it must be that; the ghost of some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming, pede claudo, years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the fault.\\u201d And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded awhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least by chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light there. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done, and raised up again\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"by the terrors of the scaffold. Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an instant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him. I resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with honesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourself how earnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to relieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the days passed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly say that\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"however, was far gone into the morning\\u2014the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the conception of the day\\u2014the inmates of my house were locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom. I crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that their unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through the corridors, a stranger in my own house;\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"the raging energies of life. The powers of Hyde seemed to have grown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly the hate that now divided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it was a thing of vital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity of that creature that shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was co-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which in themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the doctor\\u2019s cabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses, furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a business table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron. The\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on my crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet still hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger. Hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he drank it, pledged the dead man. The pangs of transformation had not done tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped hands to God. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot. I saw my life as\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger. Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was broken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain sinister\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"been sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened, according to the sawbones; and there you might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one curious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight. So had the child\\u2019s family, which was only natural. But the doctor\\u2019s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"am in error, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a phial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you to Cavendish Square exactly as it stands. \\u201cThat is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should be back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before midnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor foreseen, but because an hour when your\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"eyes) the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty manner of politeness. It did not seem as if the subject of his address were of great importance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes appeared as if he were only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on his face as he spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed to breathe such an innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet with something high too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently her eye wandered to the other, and she was surprised to recognise in\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.\\u201d \\u201cSir,\\u201d said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly possessing, \\u201cyou speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that I hear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I have gone too far in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end.\\u201d \\u201cIt is well,\\u201d replied my visitor. \\u201cLanyon, you remember your vows: what follows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who have so long been\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"earth. And next moment, with ape-like fury, he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of blows, under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped upon the roadway. At the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid fainted. It was two o\\u2019clock when she came to herself and called for the police. The murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle of the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been done, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood,\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"their minds in the man\\u2019s rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this rule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite side of the fire\\u2014a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with something of a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and kindness\\u2014you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson a sincere and warm affection. \\u201cI have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,\\u201d began the latter. \\u201cYou know that will of yours?\\u201d A close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful; but\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when he was surprised to receive a visit from Poole. \\u201cBless me, Poole, what brings you here?\\u201d he cried; and then taking a second look at him, \\u201cWhat ails you?\\u201d he added; \\u201cis the doctor ill?\\u201d \\u201cMr. Utterson,\\u201d said the man, \\u201cthere is something wrong.\\u201d \\u201cTake a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cNow, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.\\u201d \\u201cYou know the doctor\\u2019s ways, sir,\\u201d replied Poole, \\u201cand how he shuts himself up. Well, he\\u2019s shut up again in the\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"have great trouble and have to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was near despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour\\u2019s work, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took out the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and returned with it to Cavendish Square. Here I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly enough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so that it was plain they were of Jekyll\\u2019s private\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"for I declare I can see him this moment.\\u201d Mr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight of consideration. \\u201cYou are sure he used a key?\\u201d he inquired at last. \\u201cMy dear sir...\\u201d began Enfield, surprised out of himself. \\u201cYes, I know,\\u201d said Utterson; \\u201cI know it must seem strange. The fact is, if I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I know it already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have been inexact in any point you had better correct it.\\u201d \\u201cI think\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"person of Dr. Jekyll, I could enter on that of Edward Hyde without pecuniary loss. And thus fortified, as I supposed, on every side, I began to profit by the strange immunities of my position. Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own person and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did so for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy, strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty.\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"\\u201cThis is beyond me, Poole,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cLet us go back to the cabinet.\\u201d They mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional awestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine the contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been prevented. \\u201cThat is the same drug that I was always bringing him,\\u201d said Poole; and even as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"of a street in Soho. \\u201cGood God!\\u201d thought Mr. Utterson, \\u201ccan he, too, have been thinking of the will?\\u201d But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address. \\u201cAnd now,\\u201d said the other, \\u201chow did you know me?\\u201d \\u201cBy description,\\u201d was the reply. \\u201cWhose description?\\u201d \\u201cWe have common friends,\\u201d said Mr. Utterson. \\u201cCommon friends,\\u201d echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. \\u201cWho are they?\\u201d \\u201cJekyll, for instance,\\u201d said the lawyer. \\u201cHe never told you,\\u201d cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. \\u201cI did not think you would have lied.\\u201d \\u201cCome,\\u201d said Mr. Utterson, \\u201cthat\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It may then already be too late; and if that night passes without event, you will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.\\u201d Upon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane; but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound to do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less I was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"blasphemies on the pages of my books, burning the letters and destroying the portrait of my father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of death, he would long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin. But his love of life is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken and freeze at the mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and passion of this attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut him off by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him. It is\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"sir, I used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more glad to get away.\\u201d \\u201cJekyll is ill, too,\\u201d observed Utterson. \\u201cHave you seen him?\\u201d But Lanyon\\u2019s face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. \\u201cI wish to see or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,\\u201d he said in a loud, unsteady voice. \\u201cI am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any allusion to one whom I regard as dead.\\u201d \\u201cTut, tut!\\u201d said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause, \\u201cCan\\u2019t I do anything?\\u201d he\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"the bed curtains and the design of the mahogany frame; something still kept insisting that I was not where I was, that I had not wakened where I seemed to be, but in the little room in Soho where I was accustomed to sleep in the body of Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in my psychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion, occasionally, even as I did so, dropping back into a comfortable morning doze. I was still so engaged when, in one of my more wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my\"],\n [\"a\",\n\"he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this as should make his name stink from one end of London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies.

I helped the Professor in, and followed him. There was no one in the kitchen or in the servants\\u2019 rooms, which were close at hand. We tried all the rooms as we went along, and in the dining-room, dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters, found four servant-women lying on the floor.

If so, time was precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"of common earth.\\u201d I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that the boxes were \\u201cmain and mortal heavy,\\u201d and that shifting them was dry work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn\\u2019t any gentleman \\u201csuch-like as yourself, squire,\\u201d to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"was possible to see a great distance; and far off, beyond the white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way.

Then I looked around for the Count, but, with surprise and gladness, made a discovery. The room was empty!

You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of England less interesting, so that I may not forget how time flies by us,\\u201d and, with a courtly bow, he quickly left me.I went into my own room and drew the curtains, but there was little to notice; my window opened into the courtyard, all I could see was the warm grey of quickening sky. So I pulled the curtains again,\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"since I was on the Pampas and had a mare that I was fond of go to grass all in a night. One of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her in the night, and what with his gorge and the vein left open, there wasn\\u2019t enough blood in her to let her stand up, and I had to put a bullet through her as she lay. Jack, if you may tell me without betraying confidence, Arthur was the first, is not that so?\\u201d As he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious. He was in\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"ceased, and he raised himself with an apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for days and nights past\\u2014weary days and sleepless nights\\u2014he had been unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded, he could speak freely. \\u201cI know now how I suffered,\\u201d he said, as he dried his eyes, \\u201cbut I do not know even yet\\u2014and none other can ever\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"for the end has come, our effort shall not be lack. Now let us to-day put all our affairs in order. Let all things which touch on others dear to us, and who on us depend, be complete; for none of us can tell what, or when, or how, the end may be. As for me, my own affairs are regulate; and as I have nothing else to do, I shall go make arrangements for the travel. I shall have all tickets and so forth for our journey.\\u201dThere was nothing further to be said, and we parted. I shall now\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"in the sitting-room. Not there! Then I looked in all the other open rooms of the house, with an ever-growing fear chilling my heart. Finally I came to the hall door and found it open. It was not wide open, but the catch of the lock had not caught. The people of the house are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a big, heavy shawl and ran out.\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work to be done.\\u201d\\u201cAre we to have nothing to-night?\\u201d said one of them, with a low laugh, as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he nodded his head. One of the women jumped forward and opened it. If my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail,\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"to break down and have hysterics, just as he had when Lucy died, but with a great effort he controlled himself and was at perfect nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into the room, bright and happy-looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said:\\u2014\\u201cFriend John, to you with so much of experience already\\u2014and you, too, dear Madam Mina,\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward, jumped from the bow on the sand.

For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"to making myself master of the facts of his hallucination. In my manner of doing it there was, I now see, something of cruelty.

When I have returned you will be master of all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your faith, even you who have had such an experience as that\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the box-seat\\u2014\\u201cgotza\\u201d they call them\\u2014cracked his big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on our journey.I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along,\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"at once on board the Czarina Catherine, which lay at anchor out in the river harbour. There we saw the Captain, Donelson by name, who told us of his voyage. He said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a run.\\u201cMan!\\u201d he said, \\u201cbut it made us afeard, for we expeckit that we should have to pay for it wi\\u2019 some rare piece o\\u2019 ill luck, so as to keep up the average.

She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy; her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for her heart is weakening.

Ah, we were wise to keep from her the affair of the dreadful night of Lucy\\u2019s sleep-walking. 17 August.\\u2014No diary for two whole days. I have not had the heart to write. Some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness. No news from Jonathan, and Lucy seems to be growing\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"not help seeing that there was some constraint with him. The Professor noticed it, too, and motioned me to bring him upstairs. I did so, and left him at the door of the room, as I felt he would like to be quite alone with her, but he took my arm and led me in, saying huskily:\\u2014\\u201cYou loved her too, old fellow; she told me all about it, and there was no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don\\u2019t know how to thank you for all you have done for her. I can\\u2019t think yet....\\u201dHere\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"the ways of the country. I was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress\\u2014white undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and said, \\u201cThe Herr Englishman?\\u201d \\u201cYes,\\u201d I said, \\u201cJonathan Harker.\\u201d She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with a letter:\\u2014\\u201cMy Friend.\\u2014Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting you. Sleep well to-night.\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all of us\\u2014is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do we not promise to go on to the bitter end?\\u201dEach in turn, we\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"and the Vampire sleep be over.

And there remain one more victim in the Vampire fold; one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the Un-Dead!...There is some fascination, surely, when I am moved by the mere presence of such an one, even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and heavy with the dust of centuries, though there be that horrid odour such as the lairs of the Count have had.\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"had ever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of him again. This time he had broken out through the window of his room, and was running down the avenue. I called to the attendants to follow\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"no more concealment of anything amongst us. Mina is sleeping now, calmly and sweetly like a little child. Her lips are curved and her face beams with happiness. Thank God, there are such moments still for her. Later.\\u2014How strange it all is. I sat watching Mina\\u2019s happy sleep, and came as near to being happy myself as I suppose I shall ever be. As the evening drew on, and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking lower, the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me. All at once Mina opened her eyes, and looking\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"straight on, as if it knew where it was bound for or had some intention of its own. The patient grew calmer every instant, and presently said:\\u2014\\u201cYou needn\\u2019t tie me; I shall go quietly!\\u201d Without trouble we came back to the house. I feel there is something ominous in his calm, and shall not forget this night....Hillingham, 24 August.\\u2014I must imitate Mina, and keep writing things down. Then we can have long talks when we do meet. I wonder when it will be. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night I seemed to\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"she know are coming to meet us.6 November.\\u2014It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming. We did not go fast, though the way was steeply downhill, for we had to take heavy rugs and wraps with us; we dared not face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow. We had to take some of our provisions, too, for we were in a perfect desolation, and, so far as we could see through the snowfall, there was not even the\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"& Candy.\\u201d This was manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:\\u2014\\u201cYour clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their confidence. I am myself a professional man.\\u201d Here I handed him my card. \\u201cIn this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was, he understood, lately for sale.\\u201d These words put a different complexion on affairs. He said:\\u2014\\u201cI\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"she loved; and that sacred bell going \\u2018Toll! toll! toll!\\u2019 so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time their eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And all for what? She is dead; so! Is it not?\\u201d\\u201cWell, for the life of me, Professor,\\u201d I said, \\u201cI can\\u2019t see anything to laugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle than before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor Art and\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"the hand that of all she would herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?\\u2019 Tell me if there be such a one amongst us?\\u201dWe all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as snow:\\u2014\\u201cMy true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me what I am to do,\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"me that she know are coming to meet us.6 November.\\u2014It was late in the afternoon when the Professor and I took our way towards the east whence I knew Jonathan was coming.

I drove to Walworth and found, with some difficulty, Potter\\u2019s Court. Mr. Smollet\\u2019s spelling misled me, as I asked for Poter\\u2019s Court instead of Potter\\u2019s Court. However, when I had found the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran\\u2019s lodging-house. When I asked the man who came to the door for the \\u201cdepite,\\u201d he shook his head, and said: \\u201cI dunno \\u2019im. There ain\\u2019t no such a person \\u2019ere; I never \\u2019eard of \\u2019im in all my bloomin\\u2019 days.\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little, and the blood was trickling over my chin. I laid down the razor, turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking plaster. When the Count saw my face, his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury, and he suddenly made a grab at my throat. I drew away, and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix. It made an instant change in him, for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there.\\u201cTake care,\\u201d\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"cheerful all the evening. So much so that all the rest seemed to take courage, as if infected somewhat with her gaiety; as a result even I myself felt as if the pall of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted. We all retired early. Mina is now sleeping like a little child; it is a wonderful thing that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible trouble. Thank God for it, for then at least she can forget her care. Perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to-night. I shall\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"fright was not to them, so that they could break away. I feared for my dear Madam Mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round. I looked at her, but she sat calm, and smiled at me; when I would have stepped to the fire to replenish it, she caught me and held me back, and whispered, like a voice that one hears in a dream, so low it was:\\u2014\\u201cNo! No! Do not go without. Here you are safe!\\u201d I turned to her, and looking in her eyes, said:\\u2014\\u201cBut you? It is for you that I fear!\\u201d whereat\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"furthest station on the way thither that the train reached.\\u201cBe assured that he is well cared for. He has won all hearts by his sweetness and gentleness. He is truly getting on well, and I have no doubt will in a few weeks be all himself. But be careful of him for safety\\u2019s sake. There are, I pray God and St. Joseph and Ste. Mary, many, many, happy years for you both.\\u201d19 August.\\u2014Strange and sudden change in Renfield last night. About eight o\\u2019clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when setting. The attendant was\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own existing sanity. \\u201cI appeal to your friends,\\u201d he said, \\u201cthey\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"your soul. Tell me, like one good fellow to another, is there any one else that you care for? And if there is I\\u2019ll never trouble you a hair\\u2019s breadth again, but will be, if you will let me, a very faithful friend.\\u2019\\u201cMy dear Mina, why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy of them? Here was I almost making fun of this great-hearted, true gentleman. I burst into tears\\u2014I am afraid, my dear, you will think this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one\\u2014and I really felt very badly. Why can\\u2019t they let\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"the pit. His eyes were positively blazing. The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them. His face was deathly pale, and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires; the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot metal. With a fierce sweep of his arm, he hurled the woman from him, and then motioned to the others, as though he were beating them back; it was the same imperious gesture that I had seen used to the wolves. In a voice which, though\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"up by another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"cause for his anger, since he is usually such a well-behaved man, and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred. I found him, to my astonishment, quite composed and most genial in his manner. I tried to get him to talk of the incident, but he blandly asked me questions as to what I meant, and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair. It was, I am sorry to say, however, only another instance of his cunning, for within half an hour I heard of him again. This time he had\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here full of respect for you, and you have given me hope\\u2014hope, not in what I am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life happy\\u2014good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my study and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do all for him that I\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"much, but I say it in kindness\\u2014I gave what you gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights and days\\u2014before death, after death; and if my death can do her good even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.\\u201d He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected by it. He took the old man\\u2019s hand and said in a broken voice:\\u2014\\u201cOh, it is hard to think of\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"the windows. The poor man was more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said, I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears. I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"and to know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books. To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.\\u201d\\u201cBut, Count,\\u201d I said, \\u201cyou know and speak English thoroughly!\\u201d He bowed gravely.\\u201cI thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I fear that I am but\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"take hundreds of years to get so far as London; and yet in one day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He is finite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do. But we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong together. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This battle is but begun, and in the end we shall win\\u2014so sure as that God sits on high to watch over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we return.4 October.\\u2014When\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"order.In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to even attract their attention. Jonathan\\u2019s impetuosity, and the manifest singleness of his purpose, seemed to overawe those in front of him; instinctively they\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"Helsing is laconic; he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and off we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice qualities. They are very, very superstitious. In the first house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to keep off the\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"through the broken window.The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from the window, and the lights burn blue and dim. What am I to do? God shield me from harm this night! I shall hide this paper in my breast, where they shall find it when they come to lay me out. My dear mother gone! It is time that I go too. Good-bye, dear Arthur, if I should not survive this night. God keep you, dear, and God help me!18 September.\\u2014I drove at once to Hillingham and arrived early. Keeping my cab at the\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"beside him. After searching through it, he took out a selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly fashion. Then he stood up, looked into the keyhole, blew into it, and turning to his employers, made some remark. Lord Godalming smiled, and the man lifted a good-sized bunch of keys; selecting one of them, he began to probe the lock, as if feeling his way with it. After fumbling about for a bit he tried a second, and then a third. All at once the door opened under a slight push from him, and he and\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"a half-reclining figure, snowy white. The coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much, for shadow shut down on light almost immediately; but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was, whether man or beast, I could not tell; I did not wait to catch another glance, but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the fish-market to the bridge, which was the only way to reach the East Cliff. The town seemed as dead, for\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"do shall by the local people be attributed to me.It makes me rage to think that this can go on, and whilst I am shut up here, a veritable prisoner, but without that protection of the law which is even a criminal\\u2019s right and consolation.I thought I would watch for the Count\\u2019s return, and for a long time sat doggedly at the window. Then I began to notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight. They were like the tiniest grains of dust, and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired, and tied as it were to his post, experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it. All at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air; Count Dracula, jumping to his feet, said:\\u2014\\u201cWhy, there is the morning again! How remiss I am to let you stay up so long. You must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"long the sun would set. It was hard to believe that by our watches it was less than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to converge close upon us. The wind came now with fiercer and more bitter sweeps, and more steadily from the north. It seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us, for, with only occasional bursts, the snow fell. We could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party, the pursued and the pursuers. Strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realise, or at least to care, that they\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"her, tainted as she is with that Vampire baptism. \\u201cWell,\\u201d said I to myself, \\u201cif it be that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at night.\\u201d As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"one day, when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out. He is finite, though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do. But we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong together.

I am afraid to think what may happen to us. We are truly in the hands of God. He alone knows what may be, and I pray Him, with all the strength of my sad and humble soul, that He will watch over my beloved husband; that whatever may happen, Jonathan may know that I loved him and honoured him more than I can say, and that my latest and truest thought will be always for him.1 November.\\u2014All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The horses seem to know that\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist and snow; the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away towards the castle, and were lost.Instinctively, with the dawn coming, I turned to Madam Mina, intending to hypnotise her; but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep, from which I could not wake her.

To-day I have much\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"a half or three inches thick and about three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To me, a doctor\\u2019s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their courage, and remained silent and quiet.When all was ready, Van Helsing said:\\u2014\\u201cBefore we\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"want to hinder him. I suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is, when his touch is on his victim. And oh, my God, my God, pity me! He placed his reeking lips upon my throat!\\u201d Her husband groaned again. She clasped his hand harder, and looked at him pityingly, as if he were the injured one, and went on:\\u2014\\u201cI felt my strength fading away, and I was in a half swoon. How long this horrible thing lasted I know not; but it seemed that a long time must have passed before he took his foul,\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"he mixes up not only the month, but the year.\\u201cWell, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love and duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me, and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn pledge between us....\\u201cLucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"evening.\\u2014No news all day; we have found nothing of the kind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat, and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters, so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"fellow, was speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his Lucy\\u2019s veins; I could see Van Helsing\\u2019s face grow white and purple by turns. Arthur was saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married and that she was his wife in the sight of God. None of us said a word of the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The moment we were alone in the carriage he\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"It may have been that the need of natural sleep, and the strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me. Certain it was that I was lapsing into sleep, the open-eyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet fascination, when there came through the snow-stilled air a long, low wail, so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound of a clarion. For it was the voice of my dear Madam Mina that I heard.Then I braced myself again to my horrid task, and found by wrenching away tomb-tops one other of the\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"again. There is no young Arthur here now; I have to call on you yourself this time, friend John.\\u201d As he spoke, he was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion; I had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt-sleeve. There was no possibility of an opiate just at present, and no need of one; and so, without a moment\\u2019s delay, we began the operation. After a time\\u2014it did not seem a short time either, for the draining away of one\\u2019s blood, no matter how willingly it be given, is a terrible feeling\\u2014Van Helsing held\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like this ever any more;\\u201d and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own, pass in\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"eyes, \\u201cbut I do not know even yet\\u2014and none other can ever know\\u2014how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be like a brother, will you not, for all our lives\\u2014for dear Lucy\\u2019s sake?\\u201d\\u201cFor dear Lucy\\u2019s sake,\\u201d I said as we clasped hands. \\u201cAy, and for your own sake,\\u201d he added, \\u201cfor if a man\\u2019s esteem and gratitude are ever worth the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of reproach. 30 September.\\u2014The station-master was good enough to give me a line to his old companion the station-master at King\\u2019s Cross, so that when I arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper officials, and I saw that their tally\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"which is outside your daily life is not of account to you. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men\\u2019s eyes, because they know\\u2014or think they know\\u2014some things which other men have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain. But yet we see around us every day the\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"Devotion is so rare, and we are so grateful to those who show it unasked to those we love. Here was a poor girl putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved, so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest.... I must have slept long and soundly, for it was broad daylight when Van Helsing waked me by coming into my room.

To me, a doctor\\u2019s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their courage, and remained silent and quiet.When all was ready,\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"regular train. Moreover, we have something to prepare. We must think. Now let us organize. You, friend Arthur, go to the train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning. Do you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of the ship and get from him letters to the agent in Galatz, with authority to make search the ship just as it was here. Morris Quincey, you see the Vice-Consul, and get his aid with his fellow in Galatz and all he can do to make our way smooth, so that no\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"all the time\\u2014so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when she had grown more quiet:\\u2014\\u201cWill you not come over to the fire?\\u201d for I wished to make a test of what she could. She rose obedient, but when she have made a step she stopped, and stood\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"only accident or a series of accidents can balance it.\\u201cWe\\u2019ve told yarns by the camp-fire in the prairies; and dressed one another\\u2019s wounds after trying a landing at the Marquesas; and drunk healths on the shore of Titicaca. There are more yarns to be told, and other wounds to be healed, and another health to be drunk. Won\\u2019t you let this be at my camp-fire to-morrow night? I have no hesitation in asking you, as I know a certain lady is engaged to a certain dinner-party, and that you are free. There will only be one other, our old pal\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"is full of quiet joy, and her mother is glad and sorry at once. Later on in the day she told me the cause. She is grieved to lose Lucy as her very own, but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to protect her. Poor dear, sweet lady! She confided to me that she has got her death-warrant. She has not told Lucy, and made me promise secrecy; her doctor told her that within a few months, at most, she must die, for her heart is weakening. At any time, even now, a sudden shock\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"to me, and said:\\u2014\\u201cAre you satisfied now?\\u201d\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.\\u201cDo you not see the child?\\u201d\\u201cYes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?\\u201d I asked.\\u201cWe shall see,\\u201d said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child\\u2019s throat. It was without a scratch or scar of any kind.\\u201cWas I right?\\u201d I asked triumphantly.\\u201cWe were just\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"his shoulder at her as he came.I left him in the drawing-room, and told Van Helsing that he had said good-bye; so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker\\u2019s men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin. When he came out of the room again I told him of Arthur\\u2019s question, and he replied:\\u2014\\u201cI am not surprised. Just now I doubted for a moment myself!\\u201dWe all dined together, and I could see that poor Art was trying to make the best of things. Van Helsing had been silent all dinner-time; but when we\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"the door for her to pass into her room. But the instant she had disappeared he pulled me, suddenly and forcibly, into the dining-room and closed the door.Then, for the first time in my life, I saw Van Helsing break down. He raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair, and then beat his palms together in a helpless way; finally he sat down on a chair, and putting his hands before his face, began to sob, with loud, dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart. Then he raised his\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till death\\u2014a steadfastness as noble as that of the young Casabianca\\u2014and placed in the mortuary to await inquest.Already the sudden storm is passing, and its fierceness is abating; crowds are scattering homeward, and the sky is beginning to redden over the Yorkshire wolds. I shall send, in time for your next issue, further details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into harbour in the storm.9 August.\\u2014The sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"kind of way that I am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can\\u2019t forget how he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count \\u2018lord and master,\\u2019 and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way. That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him, so I suppose he isn\\u2019t above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes. It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had seen on the Count\\u2019s table before I knew of his diabolical plans. Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried out. To use an Americanism, he had \\u201ctaken no chances,\\u201d and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the logical result of\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"is to my mind the nicest spot in Whitby, for it lies right over the town, and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called Kettleness stretches out into the sea. It descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away, and some of the graves have been destroyed. In one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below. There are walks, with seats beside them, through the churchyard; and people go and sit there all day long\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"speaking between us.\\u201cI answer for Mina and myself,\\u201d he said.\\u201cCount me in, Professor,\\u201d said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.\\u201cI am with you,\\u201d said Lord Godalming, \\u201cfor Lucy\\u2019s sake, if for no other reason.\\u201dDr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling asleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then have fallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. This morning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains me. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don\\u2019t seem ever to get air enough. I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else I know\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"being I was helping to transfer to London, where, perhaps, for centuries to come he might, amongst its teeming millions, satiate his lust for blood, and create a new and ever-widening circle of semi-demons to batten on the helpless. The very thought drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face. But as I did so the\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"man, which has been ascertained for me. So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure according.\\u201cThere are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear.\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"not, like you, her lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights and days\\u2014before death, after death; and if my death can do her good even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.\\u201d He said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected by it. He took the old man\\u2019s hand and said in a broken voice:\\u2014\\u201cOh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I shall go with you and wait.\\u201d\\u201cYou were with me here yesterday. Was the\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"The remembrance seemed for a while to overpower her, and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her husband\\u2019s sustaining arm. With a great effort she recovered herself and went on:\\u2014\\u201cThen he spoke to me mockingly, \\u2018And so you, like the others, would play your brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my designs! You know now, and they know in part already, and will know in full before long, what it is to cross my path. They should have kept their energies for use closer to home. Whilst they\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"rise from the end of either pier of Whitby Harbour. The wind roared like thunder, and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet, or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions. It was found necessary to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers, or else the fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold. To add to the difficulties and dangers of the time, masses of sea-fog came drifting inland\\u2014white, wet clouds, which swept by in ghostly fashion, so dank and damp and cold that it needed\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"and then He moved the mist to the right and left, and I could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red\\u2014like His, only smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he seemed to be saying: \\u2018All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship me!\\u2019 And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close over my eyes; and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening the sash\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"see people, and learn something of their life, and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and picturesqueness of the whole wild, beautiful country and the quaint people! But, alas!\\u2014 Later.\\u2014Dr. Van Helsing has returned. He has got the carriage and horses; we are to have some dinner, and to start in an hour. The landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions; it seems enough for a company of soldiers. The Professor encourages her, and whispers to me that it may be a week before we can get any good food again. He has\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"a \\u201cbloofer lady\\u201d had asked him to come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the \\u201cbloofer lady\\u201d is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general principles of human nature\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"fair to look on, so radiantly beautiful, so exquisitely voluptuous, that the very instinct of man in me, which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers, made my head whirl with new emotion. But God be thanked, that soul-wail of my dear Madam Mina had not died out of my ears; and, before the spell could be wrought further upon me, I had nerved myself to my wild work. By this time I had searched all the tombs in the chapel, so far as I could tell; and as there had been only three\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"he can do, out of his own power, that so she come not to him. Ah! there I have hope that our man-brains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of God, will come higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries, that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work selfish and therefore small. Here comes Madam Mina; not a word to her of her trance! She know it not; and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when we want all her hope, all\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"he jumped to his feet, with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement. \\u201cTo hell with you and your souls!\\u201d he shouted. \\u201cWhy do you plague me about souls? Haven\\u2019t I got enough to worry, and pain, and distract me already, without thinking of souls!\\u201d He looked so hostile that I thought he was in for another homicidal fit, so I blew my whistle. The instant, however, that I did so he became calm, and said apologetically:\\u2014\\u201cForgive me, Doctor; I forgot myself. You do not need any help. I am so worried in my mind that\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance; but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing round me more closely.As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"of acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land to do what I can of good; at the\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium, a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"effort to move on without knowing where I am going.\\u201d\\u201cThat is good image,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWell, I shall tell you. My thesis is this: I want you to believe.\\u201d\\u201cTo believe what?\\u201d\\u201cTo believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once of an American who so defined faith: \\u2018that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue.\\u2019 For one, I follow that man. He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"thing that has done the mischief. It is a foul bauble of man\\u2019s vanity. Away with it!\\u201d and opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand, he flung out the glass, which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below. Then he withdrew without a word. It is very annoying, for I do not see how I am to shave, unless in my watch-case or the bottom of the shaving-pot, which is fortunately of metal.When I went into the dining-room, breakfast was prepared; but I could not find the Count anywhere.\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can help in your affliction, won\\u2019t you let me be of some little service\\u2014for Lucy\\u2019s sake?\\u201dIn an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat his palms together in a\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining. Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards, whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house.There was at present nothing to be\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"and my horses are swift.\\u201d As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger\\u2019s \\u201cLenore\\u201d:\\u2014\\u201cThe night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the country) underneath the seat, if you should require it.\\u201d I did not take any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a little\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"for you do not yet understand. And there may be more times when I shall want you to trust when you cannot\\u2014and may not\\u2014and must not yet understand. But the time will come when your trust shall be whole and complete in me, and when you shall understand as though the sunlight himself shone through. Then you shall bless me from first to last for your own sake, and for the sake of others and for her dear sake to whom I swore to protect.\\u201d\\u201cAnd, indeed, indeed, sir,\\u201d said Arthur warmly, \\u201cI shall in all ways trust you. I know\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"other, to a spoke of the wheel. Between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix, the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel, and all kept fast by the binding cords. The poor fellow may have been seated at one time, but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and dragged him to and fro, so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone. Accurate note was made of the state of things, and a doctor\\u2014Surgeon\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"get into the houses if they were both empty?\\u201d\\u201cThere was the old party what engaged me a-waitin\\u2019 in the \\u2019ouse at Purfleet. He \\u2019elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an\\u2019 him a old feller, with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn\\u2019t throw a shadder.\\u201dHow this phrase thrilled through me!\\u201cWhy, \\u2019e took up \\u2019is end o\\u2019 the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and me a-puffin\\u2019 an\\u2019 a-blowin\\u2019 afore I could up-end mine anyhow\\u2014an\\u2019 I\\u2019m no chicken, neither.\\u201d\\u201cHow\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"open that parcel, and know what is written. Oh, Jonathan, you will, I know, forgive me if I do wrong, but it is for your own dear sake. Later.\\u2014A sad home-coming in every way\\u2014the house empty of the dear soul who was so good to us; Jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady; and now a telegram from Van Helsing, whoever he may be:\\u2014\\u201cYou will be grieved to hear that Mrs. Westenra died five days ago, and that Lucy died the day before yesterday. They were both buried to-day.\\u201dOh, what a wealth of sorrow in\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"to me, flesh of my flesh; blood of my blood; kin of my kin; my bountiful wine-press for a while; and shall be later on my companion and my helper. You shall be avenged in turn; for not one of them but shall minister to your needs. But as yet you are to be punished for what you have done. You have aided in thwarting me; now you shall come to my call. When my brain says \\u201cCome!\\u201d to you, you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding; and to that end this!\\u2019 With that he pulled open\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the cal\\u00e8che, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon, so that we\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"there and then. The other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt-end of his heavy whip. It was a terrible blow; but he did not seem to mind it, but seized him also, and struggled with the three of us, pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens. You know I am no light weight, and the others were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat on him, he began to shout: \\u2018I\\u2019ll frustrate them!\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"turn. \\u201cGood!\\u201d he said. \\u201cYour memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise. Who knows?\\u201d I went on with my work, and before long was through that in hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was Van Helsing back in the study. \\u201cDo I interrupt?\\u201d he asked politely as he stood\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"if for their lives. Those who were unmounted jumped upon the leiter-wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them. The wolves, which had withdrawn to a safe distance, followed in their wake, leaving us alone.Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his head on his shoulder. With a sigh he\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"I did right. I have locked the door, and the key is tied to my wrist, so perhaps I shall not be again disturbed. Lucy is sleeping soundly; the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea.... Same day, noon.\\u2014All goes well. Lucy slept till I woke her and seemed not to have even changed her side. The adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed her; on the contrary, it has benefited her, for she looks better this morning than she has done for weeks. I was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"much harm and suffers not as we do. But we are strong, each in our purpose; and we are all more strong together. Take heart afresh, dear husband of Madam Mina. This battle is but begun, and in the end we shall win\\u2014so sure as that God sits on high to watch over His children. Therefore be of much comfort till we return.4 October.\\u2014When I read to Mina, Van Helsing\\u2019s message in the phonograph, the poor girl brightened up considerably. Already the certainty that the Count is out of the country has given her comfort; and comfort is strength to\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"that he cannot use them as of old. We are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to their disposition that, when we have examined the house in Piccadilly, we may track the very last of them. To-day, then, is ours; and in it rests our hope. The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course. Until it sets to-night, that monster must retain whatever form he now has. He is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope. He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies.\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"are careful to lock the door every night, so I feared that Lucy must have gone out as she was. There was no time to think of what might happen; a vague, overmastering fear obscured all details. I took a big, heavy shawl and ran out. The clock was striking one as I was in the Crescent, and there was not a soul in sight. I ran along the North Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected. At the edge of the West Cliff above the pier I looked across the harbour to the\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"which he offered me, at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked physiognomy.His face was a strong\\u2014a very strong\\u2014aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"own risk. The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain to give him every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship, and also a similar authorisation to his agent at Varna. We have seen the agent, who was much impressed with Godalming\\u2019s kindly manner to him, and we are all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done. We have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open. If the Count is there, Van Helsing and Seward will cut off his head at once and drive a\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"he said:\\u2014\\u201cMy friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me.\\u201dArthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all slept with more or less reality\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"in them, and hers had all seemed to have run out. I didn\\u2019t think of it at the time; but when she went away I began to think, and it made me mad to know that He had been taking the life out of her.\\u201d I could feel that the rest quivered, as I did, but we remained otherwise still. \\u201cSo when He came to-night I was ready for Him. I saw the mist stealing in, and I grabbed it tight. I had heard that madmen have unnatural strength; and as I knew I was a madman\\u2014at times anyhow\\u2014I resolved\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said:\\u2014\\u201cFriend John, to you with so much of experience already\\u2014and you, too, dear Madam Mina, that are young\\u2014here is a lesson: do not fear ever to think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to let him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back to where that half-thought come from and I find that he be no half-thought at all; that be a whole thought, though so young that he is not yet strong to use\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker.\\u201d\\u201cThen what are you doing here?\\u201d\\u201cMy husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward.\\u201d\\u201cThen don\\u2019t stay.\\u201d\\u201cBut why not?\\u201d I thought that this style of conversation might not be pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:\\u2014\\u201cHow did you know I wanted to marry any one?\\u201d His reply was simply contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs. Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:\\u2014\\u201cWhat an asinine question!\\u201d\\u201cI don\\u2019t see that at all, Mr. Renfield,\\u201d said\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"in the doing of work, seemingly forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing. He looked over them gravely, his face brightening up as he read. Then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said:\\u2014\\u201cFriend John, to you with so much of experience already\\u2014and you, too, dear Madam Mina, that are young\\u2014here is a lesson: do not fear ever to think. A half-thought has been buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to let him loose his wings. Here now, with more knowledge, I go back\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"her hands, cried the same words in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant emotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured, like\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit; but it was Jonathan, and he was my husband, and we didn\\u2019t know anybody who saw us\\u2014and we didn\\u2019t care if they did\\u2014so on we walked. I was looking at a very beautiful girl, in a big cart-wheel hat, sitting in a victoria outside Guiliano\\u2019s, when I felt Jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me, and he said under his breath: \\u201cMy God!\\u201d I am always anxious about Jonathan, for I fear that some nervous fit may upset him again; so I turned to\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order.In the midst of this I could see that Jonathan on one side of the ring of men, and Quincey on the other, were forcing a way to the cart; it was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set. Nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them. Neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front, nor the howling of the wolves behind, appeared to\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"resistance, whatsoever it may be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise, and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss Lucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that she is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter. He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy\\u2019s life, and we lost; and in many\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss, face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus using every projection and inequality\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"them, and then takes their silence for agreement with his views. Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock; she has got a beautiful colour since she has been here. I noticed that the old men did not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down. She is so sweet with old people; I think they all fell in love with her on the spot. Even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her, but gave me double share instead. I got him on the subject of the legends, and he\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"would sell my soul to do it!\\u201d\\u201cOh, hush, hush, my child!\\u201d said Van Helsing. \\u201cGod does not purchase souls in this wise; and the Devil, though he may purchase, does not keep faith. But God is merciful and just, and knows your pain and your devotion to that dear Madam Mina. Think you, how her pain would be doubled, did she but hear your wild words. Do not fear any of us, we are all devoted to this cause, and to-day shall see the end. The time is coming for action; to-day this Vampire is limit to the powers of\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.1 October, evening.\\u2014I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal Green, but unhappily he was not in\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"distance, followed in their wake, leaving us alone.Mr. Morris, who had sunk to the ground, leaned on his elbow, holding his hand pressed to his side; the blood still gushed through his fingers. I flew to him, for the Holy circle did not now keep me back; so did the two doctors. Jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his head on his shoulder. With a sigh he took, with a feeble effort, my hand in that of his own which was unstained. He must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face, for he\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"Dr. Van Helsing at once.\\u201d\\u201cI will go,\\u201d he said, and hurried into the Professor\\u2019s room.In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his dressing-gown, and Mr. Morris and Lord Godalming were with Dr. Seward at the door asking questions. When the Professor saw Mina smile\\u2014a positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face; he rubbed his hands as he said:\\u2014\\u201cOh, my dear Madam Mina, this is indeed a change. See! friend Jonathan, we have got our dear Madam Mina, as of old, back to us to-day!\\u201d Then turning to her, he said, cheerfully: \\u201cAnd what\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"and the others were both burly men. At first he was silent in his fighting; but as we began to master him, and the attendants were putting a strait-waistcoat on him, he began to shout: \\u2018I\\u2019ll frustrate them! They shan\\u2019t rob me! they shan\\u2019t murder me by inches! I\\u2019ll fight for my Lord and Master!\\u2019 and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings. It was with very considerable difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded room. One of the attendants, Hardy, had a finger broken. However, I set it all right; and he\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me: beside the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist\\u2014or rather as if the mist had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared\\u2014stood a tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of the others.

Once I got a fright, for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to see the high lights of the Count\\u2019s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the red eyes, the red\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"he said, \\u201cand study them well. When I have returned you will be master of all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What is here told,\\u201d he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of papers as he spoke, \\u201cmay be the beginning of the end to you and me and many another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"be assured.\\u201d I laughed\\u2014it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am bound to say\\u2014as I motioned him to keep it. \\u201cA key is nothing,\\u201d I said; \\u201cthere may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of that kind.\\u201d He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight.It was\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"of the chief boatman, I was, as your correspondent, permitted to climb on deck, and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel.It was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised, or even awed, for not often can such a sight have been seen. The man was simply fastened by his hands, tied one over the other, to a spoke of the wheel.

Dr. Van Helsing must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur\\u2019s friend and Dr. Seward\\u2019s, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he is good and kind and of a noble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan; and then, please God,\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of negative condition, as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows; when, however, the freedom ceases the change-back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence.To-night, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and bore all the signs of an internal struggle. I put it down myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"the door, and on his calling out, \\u201cCome in,\\u201d I entered.To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone, and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the description to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much interested.\\u201cI hope I did not keep you waiting,\\u201d I said; \\u201cbut I stayed at the door as I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you.\\u201d\\u201cOh,\\u201d he replied with a smile, \\u201cI was only entering my diary.\\u201d\\u201cYour diary?\\u201d I asked him in surprise.\\u201cYes,\\u201d he answered. \\u201cI\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"for Lucy\\u2019s sake?\\u201dArthur spoke out heartily, like his old self:\\u2014\\u201cDr. Van Helsing, you may do what you will. I feel that in saying this I am doing what my dear one would have approved. I shall not trouble you with questions till the time comes.\\u201dThe old Professor stood up as he said solemnly:\\u2014\\u201cAnd you are right. There will be pain for us all; but it will not be all pain, nor will this pain be the last. We and you too\\u2014you most of all, my dear boy\\u2014will have to pass through the bitter water before we reach the sweet. But\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such allies as these at his command, I could do nothing. But still the door continued slowly to open, and only the Count\\u2019s body stood in the gap. Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and as a last chance I cried out:\\u2014\\u201cShut the\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"all these centuries, is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world. There are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither. There have been volcanoes, some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties, and gases that kill or make to vivify. Doubtless, there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way; and in himself were from the first some great qualities. In a hard and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve, more subtle brain, more braver\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"as now, empty. We then waited, and saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?\\u201d\\u201cYes.\\u201d\\u201cThat night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing, and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic, which\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"me not think of it. Action!It has always been at night-time that I have been molested or threatened, or in some way in danger or in fear. I have not yet seen the Count in the daylight. Can it be that he sleeps when others wake, that he may be awake whilst they sleep? If I could only get into his room! But there is no possible way. The door is always locked, no way for me.Yes, there is a way, if one dares to take it. Where his body has gone why may not another body go? I have\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"I am getting so strong again that I hardly know myself. It is as if I had passed through some long nightmare, and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me. I have a dim half-remembrance of long, anxious times of waiting and fearing; darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant: and then long spells of oblivion, and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water. Since, however, Dr. Van Helsing has\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"came to see that was friend of that poor dear child Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come.\\u201d\\u201cSir,\\u201d I said, \\u201cyou could have no better claim on me than that you were a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra.\\u201d And I held out my hand. He took it and said tenderly:\\u2014\\u201cOh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be good, but I had yet to learn\\u2014\\u2014\\u201d He finished his speech with a courtly bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"his behalf, it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not stinted. Is it not so?\\u201dWhat could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins\\u2019s interest, not mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"do meet. I wonder when it will be. I wish she were with me again, for I feel so unhappy. Last night I seemed to be dreaming again just as I was at Whitby. Perhaps it is the change of air, or getting home again. It is all dark and horrid to me, for I can remember nothing; but I am full of vague fear, and I feel so weak and worn out. When Arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved when he saw me, and I hadn\\u2019t the spirit to try to be cheerful. I wonder if I\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"after a long pause, he said to me in a faint whisper:\\u2014\\u201cJack, is she really dead?\\u201dI assured him sadly that it was so, and went on to suggest\\u2014for I felt that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than I could help\\u2014that it often happened that after death faces became softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty; that this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering. It seemed to quite do away with any doubt, and, after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound. The next instant, with a sinuous dive he swept under Harker\\u2019s arm, ere his blow could fall, and, grasping a handful of the money from the floor, dashed across the room, threw himself at the window. Amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass, he tumbled into the flagged area below. Through the sound of the shivering glass I could hear the \\u201cting\\u201d of the gold, as some of the sovereigns fell\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"child-brain; for had he dared, at the first, to attempt certain things he would long ago have been beyond our power. However, he means to succeed, and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow. Festina lente may well be his motto.\\u201d\\u201cI fail to understand,\\u201d said Harker wearily. \\u201cOh, do be more plain to me! Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain.\\u201dThe Professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke:\\u2014\\u201cAh, my child, I will be plain. Do you not see how, of late, this monster has been creeping into\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"had to arrange as best he could.Secondly we must see, as well as we can surmise it from the facts we know of, what he has done here.As to the first, he evidently intended to arrive at Galatz, and sent invoice to Varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of exit from England; his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape. The proof of this, is the letter of instructions sent to Immanuel Hildesheim to clear and take away the box before sunrise. There is also the instruction to Petrof Skinsky. These we must only guess\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may understand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs. Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even a negative one,\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"ran to push it open, I found that it was hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing round me more closely.As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes, with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the box being nailed down. Now I can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall, with many other idle feet coming behind them.The door is shut, and the chains rattle; there\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"voice:\\u2014\\u201cLet us talk of that part of it in the morning. I want to consult with Mina.\\u201d I thought that now was the time for Van Helsing to warn him not to disclose our plans to her; but he took no notice. I looked at him significantly and coughed. For answer he put his finger on his lips and turned away.5 October, afternoon.\\u2014For some time after our meeting this morning I could not think. The new phases of things leave my mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought. Mina\\u2019s determination not to take any\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"in the carriage from Veresti was useful; though the doors were all open I broke them off the rusty hinges, lest some ill-intent or ill-chance should close them, so that being entered I might not get out. Jonathan\\u2019s bitter experience served me here. By memory of his diary I found my way to the old chapel, for I knew that here my work lay. The air was oppressive; it seemed as if there was some sulphurous fume, which at times made me dizzy.

It is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are watched.To-day Harker is out following up his clue, and Art and Quincey are looking after horses. Godalming thinks that it will be well to have horses always in readiness, for when we get the information which we seek there will be no time to lose. We must sterilise all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset; we shall thus catch the Count at his weakest, and without a refuge to fly to.

I am content if I am like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his speaking if he hear my words, \\u2018Ha, ha! a stranger!\\u2019 I have been so long master that I would be master still\\u2014or at least that none other should be master of me.

I raised the blind, and looked out of the window. There was much moonshine; and as I looked I could see Quincey Morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yew-tree. It puzzled me to think why he was doing this; but at the instant I\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"but it pours. How true the old proverbs are. Here am I, who shall be twenty in September, and yet I never had a proposal till to-day, not a real proposal, and to-day I have had three. Just fancy! THREE proposals in one day! Isn\\u2019t it awful! I feel sorry, really and truly sorry, for two of the poor fellows. Oh, Mina, I am so happy that I don\\u2019t know what to do with myself. And three proposals! But, for goodness\\u2019 sake, don\\u2019t tell any of the girls, or they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors of non causa and ignoratio elenchi.\\u201d I positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet lunatic\\u2014the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met with\\u2014talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker\\u2019s presence which had touched some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous,\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts, she began:\\u2014\\u201cI took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me, but for a long time it did not act. I seemed to become more wakeful, and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind\\u2014all of them connected with death, and vampires; with blood, and pain, and trouble.\\u201d Her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly: \\u201cDo not fret, dear. You must be brave and strong, and help me through the horrible task. If you only knew what an effort it\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"that we saw justified under our very eyes.

I am with so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.\\u201d I would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded and stood silent.\\u201cShe is one of God\\u2019s women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and other\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"am getting nervous and wakeful myself. Thank God, Lucy\\u2019s health keeps up. Mr. Holmwood has been suddenly called to Ring to see his father, who has been taken seriously ill.

I pray it will all last. 3 August.\\u2014Another week gone, and no news from Jonathan, not even to Mr. Hawkins, from whom I have heard. Oh, I do hope he is not ill.

All Lucy\\u2019s loveliness had come back to her in death, and the hours that had passed, instead of leaving traces of \\u201cdecay\\u2019s effacing fingers,\\u201d had but restored the beauty of life, till positively I could not believe my eyes that I was looking at a corpse.The Professor looked sternly grave. He had not loved her as I had, and there was no need for tears in his eyes. He said to me: \\u201cRemain till I return,\\u201d and\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild, so ear-piercing, so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day. For a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray. Her face was ghastly, with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin; from her throat trickled a thin stream of blood; her eyes were mad with terror. Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore on their\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"his manhood; for when Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I hope he didn\\u2019t think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I know he never will\\u2014he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I could see that his heart was breaking:\\u2014\\u201cI loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:\\u2014\\u201cAh, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!\\u201dAs I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker\\u2019s suggestion; at which the Professor interrupted me:\\u2014\\u201cAh, that\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost her appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so faithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well. However, to-night she is more vif. Her long sleep all day have refresh and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset I try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown less and less with each day, and\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"if I wished it I could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but in his own smooth, resistless way:\\u2014\\u201cI pray you, my good young friend, that you will not discourse of things other than business in your letters. It will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well, and that you look forward to getting home to them. Is it not so?\\u201d As he spoke he handed me three sheets of note-paper and three envelopes. They\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you will let me know.\\u201d He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that I felt it would comfort him, so I said:\\u2014\\u201cI promise.\\u201dAs I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window. He turned as he heard my footsteps. \\u201cHow is Art?\\u201d he said. Then noticing my red eyes, he went on: \\u201cAh, I see you have been comforting him. Poor old fellow!\"],\n [\"b\",\n\"such a moment, the way in which a dominant spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were just behind the door, so that when\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"back in the corner. Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating. Only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the habit of putting things into this room that they had no\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That\\u2019s just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss himself\\u2014it\\u2019s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And you\\u2019re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor. \\u201cListen\\u201d, said the chief clerk in the next room, \\u201che\\u2019s turning the key.\\u201d Gregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his mother too: \\u201cWell done, Gregor\\u201d, they should have cried, \\u201ckeep at it, keep hold of the lock!\\u201d And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to move, it would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back from their decision to move was much more to do with their total despair, and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to. They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people, Gregor\\u2019s father brought bank employees their breakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers, his sister ran back and forth\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it open; people often do in homes where something awful has happened. Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn\\u2019t understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than before\\u2014perhaps his ears had become used to the sound. They had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help. The first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"in would seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot. And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the others didn\\u2019t know what was happening, they were worried, that would excuse their behaviour. The chief clerk now raised his voice, \\u201cMr. Samsa\\u201d, he called to him, \\u201cwhat is wrong? You\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"Gregor remained all this time on the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever he did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long, as for each step his father took he had to carry out countless movements. He became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable. Now, as he lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for running he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"Gregor learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days. It was not a lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated. Besides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had been bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution. He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father\\u2019s debt\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"him feel quite sad. \\u201cHow about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense\\u201d, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn\\u2019t get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn\\u2019t have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"there were little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it. At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood\\u2014cleaning up Gregor\\u2019s room was for her and her alone. Gregor\\u2019s mother did once\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"himself. Why did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldn\\u2019t get out of bed if he didn\\u2019t spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries\\u2014assuming enquiries were even necessary\\u2014did the chief clerk have to come\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him. \\u201cSeven o\\u2019clock, already\\u201d, he said to himself when the clock struck again, \\u201cseven o\\u2019clock, and there\\u2019s still a fog like this.\\u201d And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state. But then he said to himself: \\u201cBefore it strikes quarter past seven I\\u2019ll definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody will have come round from work to ask what\\u2019s happened to me as well,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat\\u2014leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it\\u2014out of the way in a corner. His sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one on each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor, all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides. With his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand all of this much longer. They were emptying his room out; taking away everything that was dear to him; they had already taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools; now they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place clearly worn into the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make them look away. \\u201cGrete, come with us in here for a little while\\u201d, said Mrs. Samsa with a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide. Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it. It was already the end of March, after all. The three gentlemen stepped out of their room\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"be if somebody came to help him. Two strong people\\u2014he had his father and the maid in mind\\u2014would have been more than enough; they would only have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use. Should he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"stopped speaking and helped Gregor\\u2019s sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she had. The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay. Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out of the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about it. He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but, unfortunately, it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the next room\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"floor, the desk where he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at infant school\\u2014he really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women\\u2019s intentions were good. He had nearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped heavily on the floor. So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not knowing what he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"for getting through the doorway. What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon he was stuck\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"back quite soon; Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her. \\u201cWhat shall we take now, then?\\u201d, said Grete and looked around. Her eyes met those of Gregor on the wall. Perhaps only because her mother was there, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice: \\u201cCome on, let\\u2019s go back in the living room for a while?\\u201d Gregor could see what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day, even things that were quite near; he had used to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance. Gregor also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come. \\u201cYou can come in, he can\\u2019t be seen\\u201d, said his sister, obviously leading her in by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it from its place, his sister always taking on\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on. If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it; but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"flat on his back before entering the room. He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud \\u201cOh!\\u201d, which sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him\\u2014he was the nearest to the door\\u2014his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force. Gregor\\u2019s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk\\u2019s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much better. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into Gregor\\u2019s room, then she would go straight to the window and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it was cold, she would\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his body. Now they did become a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was his father\\u2019s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"with potatoes. The food was steaming, and filled the room with its smell. The gentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before eating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as an authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the kitchen. It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor\\u2019s mother and sister, who had been looking\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"near; he had used to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the whole year away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it\\u2019s almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don\\u2019t usually even hear about them, or if at all it\\u2019s when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that\\u2019s when we feel the harmful effects of what\\u2019s been going on without even knowing what caused them. Please, don\\u2019t go away, at least first say something to show that you grant that I\\u2019m at least partly right!\\u201d But the chief clerk had turned\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"had not been working\\u2014the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success\\u2014he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would Gregor\\u2019s elderly mother now have to go and earn money? She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home, every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window. Would his sister have to go and earn money? She was still a child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"be neglected. Now, though, the charwoman was here. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn\\u2019t really repelled by Gregor. Just by chance one day, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor\\u2019s room and found herself face to face with him. He was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in front of her. From then on she never failed to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"all her courage, was still just a child after all, and really might not have had an adult\\u2019s appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on. Gregor\\u2019s wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into the habit\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table\\u2014Samsa was a travelling salesman\\u2014and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor\\u2019s mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to be heard. Gregor\\u2019s sister would often write and tell him about this reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It was so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody in the flat. \\u201cWhat a quiet life it is the family lead\\u201d, said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"while they were writing to tell them she was going, she\\u2019d finished her work for that morning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. \\u201cWell?\\u201d, asked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. \\u201cI\\u2019d like to eat something\\u201d, said Gregor anxiously, \\u201cbut not anything like they\\u2019re eating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!\\u201d Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the violin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"become used to the idea, not without reason, that she was Gregor\\u2019s spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him. This meant that his mother\\u2019s advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had thought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch. It was more than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made her insist; she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the furniture,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"he looked round in the darkness. He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all. This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural. He also felt relatively comfortable. It is true that his entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether. He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust. He thought\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"no more than the object and the hand that held it. The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else. At first he moved it because, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"down below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae\\u2014of which he was now beginning to learn the value\\u2014in order to see what had been happening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning\\u2014it was nearly a miracle that only one of them had been\\u2014and dragged along lifelessly. It was only when he had reached the door that he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"it sounded to Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end. Or he might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to stare out of it. He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day, even things that were quite near; he had used to curse the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the visitor\\u2019s first words of greeting and he knew who it was\\u2014the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldn\\u2019t get out of bed if he didn\\u2019t spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"were all pressed against the door and listening. Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth\\u2014how was he, then, to grasp the key?\\u2014but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"desk where he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at infant school\\u2014he really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women\\u2019s intentions were good. He had nearly forgotten they were there anyway, as they were now too tired to say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped heavily on the floor. So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times not knowing what he should save\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"short periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised. Their parents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day. That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state, pressed upright against the door and listening. There were times when he simply became too tired to continue\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"again. Please don\\u2019t make things any harder for me than they are already, and don\\u2019t take sides against me at the office. I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That\\u2019s just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss himself\\u2014it\\u2019s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. But now that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position all that secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I don\\u2019t see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it\\u2019s not the time of year to do especially good business,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"knocking at the door again. \\u201cNo\\u201d, said Gregor. In the room on his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry. So why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she crying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"that they could all forget about it as quickly as possible. So then he started working especially hard, with a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earn money in quite different ways. Gregor converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and delighted family. They had been good times and they had never come again, at least not with the same splendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. \\u201cWell?\\u201d, asked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all directions. \\u201cWhat is it you want then?\\u201d, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"nourishment he had been yearning for. He was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would. He never wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"couldn\\u2019t have flown away\\u2014she was so shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut again from outside. But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him in some other food\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"than not\\u2014had been left totally untouched. She still cleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any quicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there were little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall\\u2014which was already denuded of everything else that had been on it\\u2014of the lady dressed in copious fur. He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly. This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by no-one. He turned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they came back. They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to be neglected. Now, though, the charwoman was here. This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in her long life, wasn\\u2019t really repelled by Gregor. Just by chance one day, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor\\u2019s room and found herself face to face with him. He was taken totally by surprise, no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in front of her. From then on she never failed\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"burdensome job she had taken on. Gregor\\u2019s wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night, his food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling. He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was quite\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand very well; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for the future. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended on it!\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it open; people often do in homes where something awful has happened. Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn\\u2019t understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than before\\u2014perhaps his ears had become used to the sound. They had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help. The first response\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him with the windows closed. One day, about a month after Gregor\\u2019s transformation when his sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most horrible. In itself, his sister\\u2019s not coming into the room would have been\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. \\u201cI\\u2019d like to eat something\\u201d, said Gregor anxiously, \\u201cbut not anything like they\\u2019re eating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!\\u201d Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the violin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now they leant back\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"big, loud \\u201cNo\\u201d, and no more would be said. Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained to Gregor\\u2019s mother and sister what their finances and prospects were. Now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five years earlier. Gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted. What he heard his father say was some of the first good\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"father and mother paid close attention, one on each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in the living room. Before, he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others. What\\u2019s more, there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest movement; he carried\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. An apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor\\u2019s back and slid off without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following it, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out, all\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"than she would quickly close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into Gregor\\u2019s room, then she would go straight to the window and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it was cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while. She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal, but it was impossible\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all was quiet. It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadn\\u2019t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much better. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into Gregor\\u2019s room, then she would go straight\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor\\u2019s mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service. She even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened, even though no-one had asked that of her. Now Gregor\\u2019s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking; although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. Gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive no more answer than \\u201cno thanks, I\\u2019ve had\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, called out \\u201cCheerio then, everyone\\u201d, turned round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went. \\u201cTonight she gets sacked\\u201d, said Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace they had only just gained. They got up and went over to the window where they remained with their arms around each other. Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while. Then he called out: \\u201cCome\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignoring her mother\\u2019s warnings that she would strain herself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor\\u2019s father got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way even more, and\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"for the doctor straight away. Gregor is ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just now?\\u201d \\u201cThat was the voice of an animal\\u201d, said the chief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother\\u2019s screams. \\u201cAnna! Anna!\\u201d his father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping his hands, \\u201cget a locksmith here, now!\\u201d And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There was no\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use. Should he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought. After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time was now\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Gregor\\u2019s father to a halt. \\u201cI declare here and now\\u201d, he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor\\u2019s mother and sister to gain their attention too, \\u201cthat with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family\\u201d\\u2014here he looked briefly but decisively at the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"so that that, too, had been accumulating. Behind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution. He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father\\u2019s debt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things. This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one or two years, no more. That\\u2019s\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o\\u2019clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively. And\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that he could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister\\u2019s sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was only later, when she had become a little more used to everything\\u2014there was, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the situation\\u2014that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"made plans of how he could get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to, even if he was not hungry. Gregor\\u2019s sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it away again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or\\u2014more often than not\\u2014had been left totally untouched. She still cleared up the room in\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"if he were both angry and glad at the same time. Gregor drew his head back from the door and lifted it towards his father. He really had not imagined his father the way he stood there now; of late, with his new habit of crawling about, he had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way he had done before. He really ought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father? The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise. She immediately picked it up\\u2014using a rag, not her bare hands\\u2014and carried it out. Gregor was extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did bring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; a few raisins\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"probably, some bank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high. Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time with that\\u2014he knew full well, right from the first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"off so completely. She left the sheet where it was. Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked the new arrangement. For the first fourteen days, Gregor\\u2019s parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him. He would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"though, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him. \\u201cSeven o\\u2019clock, already\\u201d, he said to himself when the clock struck again, \\u201cseven o\\u2019clock, and there\\u2019s still a fog like this.\\u201d And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: \\u201cGregor, open the door, I beg of you.\\u201d Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home. The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in vain. The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides. It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"this surplus money to reduce his father\\u2019s debt to his boss, and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer, but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things. This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one or two years, no more. That\\u2019s to say, it was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies; money to live on had to be earned. His father was healthy\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. \\u201cWell?\\u201d, asked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa all the time she had been working for them,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor, against their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. \\u201cGregor, Gregor\\u201d, he called, \\u201cwhat\\u2019s wrong?\\u201d And after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: \\u201cGregor! Gregor!\\u201d At the other side door his sister came plaintively: \\u201cGregor? Aren\\u2019t you well? Do you need anything?\\u201d Gregor answered to both sides: \\u201cI\\u2019m ready, now\\u201d, making an effort\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"any thought for the future. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister were here! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was not there, Gregor would\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his mouth to play with it, leave it there a few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again. At first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes made there. They had got into the habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest gentlemen\\u2014all three of them had full\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the harmful effects of what\\u2019s been going on without even knowing what caused them. Please, don\\u2019t go away, at least first say something to show that you grant that I\\u2019m at least partly right!\\u201d But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment while Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been some secret\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"around it with some surprise. She immediately picked it up\\u2014using a rag, not her bare hands\\u2014and carried it out. Gregor was extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did bring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa, put his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards Gregor. He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high. Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time with that\\u2014he knew full well, right from the first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to always\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: \\u201cHelp, for pity\\u2019s sake, Help!\\u201d The way she held her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the unthinking\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"in near perfect silence. It seemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had wanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be. \\u201cI\\u2019d like to eat something\\u201d, said Gregor anxiously, \\u201cbut not anything like they\\u2019re eating. They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!\\u201d Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the violin being played, but this evening it began\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"had become convinced that this job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for the future. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister were here! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"have been living here I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you, and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action.\\u201d He was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something. And indeed, his two friends joined in with the words: \\u201cAnd we also give immediate notice.\\u201d With that, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door. Gregor\\u2019s father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"immobile. \\u201cWe have to try and get rid of it\\u201d, said Gregor\\u2019s sister, now speaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to listen, \\u201cit\\u2019ll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming. We can\\u2019t all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured like this, we can\\u2019t endure it. I can\\u2019t endure it any more.\\u201d And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements. \\u201cMy child\\u201d, said\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"himself up; but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully. \\u201cThis is something that can\\u2019t be done in bed\\u201d, Gregor said to himself, \\u201cso don\\u2019t keep trying to do it\\u201d. The first thing he wanted to do was get\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to wait until midday before his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than usual. It made him realise that she still found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so, she probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to spare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"representative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earn money in quite different ways. Gregor converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and delighted family. They had been good times and they had never come again, at least not with the same splendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them. They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"chance. Gregor also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come. \\u201cYou can come in, he can\\u2019t be seen\\u201d, said his sister, obviously leading her in by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignoring her mother\\u2019s warnings that she would strain\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"backwards and was only able to go very slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father\\u2019s hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"day with this running about and noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him with the windows closed. One day, about a month after Gregor\\u2019s transformation when his sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most horrible.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"clear whether it was his father\\u2019s behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without knowing it. They asked Gregor\\u2019s father for explanations, raised their arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly. Meanwhile Gregor\\u2019s sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted. She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing, but\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room. Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook. So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints, and it\\u2019s almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don\\u2019t usually even hear about them, or if at all it\\u2019s when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that\\u2019s when we feel the harmful effects of what\\u2019s been going on without even knowing what caused them. Please, don\\u2019t go away, at least first say something to show that you grant that I\\u2019m at least partly right!\\u201d But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the others didn\\u2019t know what was happening, they were worried, that would excuse their behaviour. The chief clerk now raised his voice, \\u201cMr. Samsa\\u201d, he called to him, \\u201cwhat is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more than yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail\\u2014and I mention this just by the way\\u2014you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of. I\\u2019m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer, and really must request a\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor. \\u201cListen\\u201d, said the chief clerk in the next room, \\u201che\\u2019s turning the key.\\u201d Gregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his mother too: \\u201cWell done, Gregor\\u201d, they should have cried, \\u201ckeep at it, keep hold of the lock!\\u201d And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on. If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and answer it. His father had arrived home. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s happened?\\u201d were his first words; Grete\\u2019s appearance must have made everything clear to him. She answered him with subdued voice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: \\u201cMother\\u2019s fainted, but she\\u2019s better now. Gregor got out.\\u201d \\u201cJust as I expected\\u201d, said his father, \\u201cjust as I always said, but you women wouldn\\u2019t listen, would you.\\u201d It was clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father took it to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"thought that he could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister\\u2019s sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was only later, when she had become a little more used to everything\\u2014there was, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the situation\\u2014that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly. \\u201cHe\\u2019s enjoyed his dinner today\\u201d, she might say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him, or if he left most of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him. \\u201cSeven o\\u2019clock, already\\u201d, he said to himself when the clock struck again, \\u201cseven o\\u2019clock, and there\\u2019s still a fog like this.\\u201d And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Hardly had that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them; to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor. His mother was\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"for so long. The food came out again just the same as when it went in\\u201d. Gregor\\u2019s body was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did he do anything to make them look away. \\u201cGrete, come with us in here for a little while\\u201d, said Mrs. Samsa with a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body. The cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide. Although it was still\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to his father, stopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, even slightly. In this way they went round the room several times without anything decisive happening, without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly. Gregor remained all this time on the floor, largely because he feared his father might see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling. Whatever he did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long, as for each step his father took\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"sister liked the new arrangement. For the first fourteen days, Gregor\\u2019s parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him. He would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her. But now the two of them, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor\\u2019s room while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"in gruff reply to this question, the chief clerk\\u2019s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right, Gregor\\u2019s sister whispered to him to let him know: \\u201cGregor, the chief clerk is here.\\u201d \\u201cYes, I know\\u201d, said Gregor to himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him. \\u201cGregor\\u201d, said his father now from the room to his left, \\u201cthe chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn\\u2019t leave on the early train. We don\\u2019t know what\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or\\u2014more often than not\\u2014had been left totally untouched. She still cleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any quicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there were little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt as\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"Gregor slowly and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the conversation. \\u201cWell I can\\u2019t think of any other way of explaining it, Mrs. Samsa\\u201d, said the chief clerk, \\u201cI hope it\\u2019s nothing serious. But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.\\u201d \\u201cCan the chief clerk come in to see you now then?\\u201d, asked his father impatiently, knocking at the door again. \\u201cNo\\u201d, said Gregor. In the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"himself upright. He really did want to open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor\\u2019s responsibility and he could rest. If, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight o\\u2019clock. The first few times he tried to climb\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"they had hoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations. But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address. He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it would have been quite easy to transport\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the evenings; who was hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raise his arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they went for a walk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always labour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking slowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully and, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his companions around him. He was\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"chief clerk exclaim a loud \\u201cOh!\\u201d, which sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him\\u2014he was the nearest to the door\\u2014his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force. Gregor\\u2019s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk\\u2019s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: \\u201cHelp, for pity\\u2019s sake, Help!\\u201d The way she held her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet. \\u201cMother, mother\\u201d,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"time was spent in worries and vague hopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being he must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced to impose on them. Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new positions. \\u201cAlright, we\\u2019ll go then\\u201d, he said, and looked up at Mr. Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision. Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times. At that, and without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and had been listening to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"\\u201cI\\u2019m ready, now\\u201d, making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: \\u201cGregor, open the door, I beg of you.\\u201d Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home. The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk\\u2019s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room. Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook. So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"before; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor\\u2019s use, and placed it beside them. Then, out of consideration for Gregor\\u2019s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her, she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he liked. Gregor\\u2019s little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What\\u2019s more, his injuries\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive. So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first, carefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily, and\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which had been a source of irritation to Mr. Samsa all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all directions. \\u201cWhat is it you want then?\\u201d, asked Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most respect for. \\u201cYes\\u201d, she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement, \\u201cI\\u2019ll open up immediately, just a moment. I\\u2019m slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven\\u2019t been able to get up. I\\u2019m still in bed now. I\\u2019m quite fresh again now, though. I\\u2019m just getting out of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It\\u2019s not quite as easy as I\\u2019d thought. I\\u2019m quite alright now, though. It\\u2019s shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last night already. They\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"had still hurt the day before yesterday. \\u201cAm I less sensitive than I used to be, then?\\u201d, he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another, his eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn\\u2019t like at all, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he couldn\\u2019t stand the smell. Long after he had finished\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn\\u2019t know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position. \\u201cGetting up early all the time\\u201d, he thought, \\u201cit makes you stupid. You\\u2019ve got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s happened to me?\\u201d he thought. It wasn\\u2019t a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table\\u2014Samsa was a travelling salesman\\u2014and above it there hung a\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"come in, he can\\u2019t be seen\\u201d, said his sister, obviously leading her in by the hand. The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignoring her mother\\u2019s warnings that she would strain herself. This lasted a very long time. After labouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"so that she would not look round and said, albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice: \\u201cCome on, let\\u2019s go back in the living room for a while?\\u201d Gregor could see what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down from the wall. Well, she could certainly try it! He sat unyielding on his picture. He would rather jump at Grete\\u2019s face. But Grete\\u2019s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper, and before\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"more quickly moving toward. Under his sister\\u2019s experienced hand, the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room. Gregor\\u2019s father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants. He urged them and pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Gregor\\u2019s father to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"going to get rid of it. That\\u2019s all been sorted out.\\u201d Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were writing; Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite clear that she was not to. So, as she was prevented from telling them all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, called out \\u201cCheerio then, everyone\\u201d, turned round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went. \\u201cTonight she gets\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"end? That was something that Gregor did not want to think about too much, so he started to move about, crawling up and down the room. Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"she could certainly try it! He sat unyielding on his picture. He would rather jump at Grete\\u2019s face. But Grete\\u2019s words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw screamed: \\u201cOh God, oh God!\\u201d Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile. \\u201cGregor!\\u201d shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of the lock!\\u201d And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor\\u2019s sign that he could break his concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"in self confidence. During the five years that he had not been working\\u2014the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success\\u2014he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy. Would Gregor\\u2019s elderly mother now have to go and earn money? She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home, every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window. Would his sister have to go and earn money? She was still a child of seventeen,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the two of them, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor\\u2019s room while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen. His mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded her against it. Gregor listened very closely to all this, and approved fully. Later, though, she had to be\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left the milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn\\u2019t do it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it, although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch, throw himself at his sister\\u2019s feet and beg her for something good to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"something that she would be able to do by herself; she did not dare to ask for help from her father; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when Gregor\\u2019s father was not there and fetch his mother to help her. As she approached the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn\\u2019t have my parents to think about I\\u2019d have given in my notice a long time ago, I\\u2019d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He\\u2019d fall right off his desk! And it\\u2019s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that protruded from under the couch. One day, in order to spare her even this sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down. If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for Gregor to cut himself\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"so Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch. In his startlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a little. It was enough to attract his mother\\u2019s attention. She stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to Grete. Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all, but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"all the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought. After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. \\u201cThat\\u2019ll be someone from work\\u201d, he said to himself, and froze very still, although his little legs only became all the more lively\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen. The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and smoking. When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood up and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood pressed against each other. Someone must have heard them in the kitchen, as Gregor\\u2019s father called out: \\u201cIs the playing perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"better position later on. Sometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor\\u2019s mother \\u201cyou\\u2019re doing so much sewing again today!\\u201d, as if he did not know that he had been dozing\\u2014and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin. With a kind of stubbornness, Gregor\\u2019s father refused to take his uniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg Gregor\\u2019s father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"rest. No-one was making him rush any more, everything was left up to him. As soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead. He was amazed at the great distance that separated him from his room, and could not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little while before and almost without noticing it. He concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him. He did not turn his head until he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death; he could not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about, he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table. He lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn himself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn. If only his father would stop that unbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused. When he had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened, even though no-one had asked that of her. Now Gregor\\u2019s sister also had to help his mother with the cooking; although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much. Gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive no more answer than \\u201cno thanks, I\\u2019ve had enough\\u201d or something similar. No-one drank very much either. His sister would sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the chance to go and fetch it herself. When\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to bear it; but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course, the better she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much better. It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room. No sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"now, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple after another. These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors. An apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor\\u2019s back and slid off without doing any harm. Another one however, immediately following it, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag himself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out, all his senses in\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"idea that Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway. What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted itself,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"parents, who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on their own chairs; his father leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat\\u2014leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it\\u2014out of the way in a corner. His sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one on each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"moved about his room. It was only later, when she had become a little more used to everything\\u2014there was, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the situation\\u2014that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly. \\u201cHe\\u2019s enjoyed his dinner today\\u201d, she might say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him, or if he left most of it, which slowly became more and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, \\u201cnow everything\\u2019s just been left there again\\u201d. Although Gregor wasn\\u2019t able\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it away again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or\\u2014more often than not\\u2014had been left totally untouched. She still cleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any quicker about it. Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there were little balls of dust and filth. At first, Gregor went\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"again; they must have left it open; people often do in homes where something awful has happened. Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn\\u2019t understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than before\\u2014perhaps his ears had become used to the sound. They had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help. The first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"uncomfortable but peaceful. As soon as it struck ten, Gregor\\u2019s mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn\\u2019t sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work. But since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"was his mother\\u2014\\u201cit\\u2019s quarter to seven. Didn\\u2019t you want to go somewhere?\\u201d That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the circumstances\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"once to hiss and spit at the attackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about it last Christmas\\u2014had Christmas really come and gone already?\\u2014if this misfortune hadn\\u2019t got in the way, and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would break out in tears of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"in while they were writing to tell them she was going, she\\u2019d finished her work for that morning. The three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation. \\u201cWell?\\u201d, asked Mr. Samsa. The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked to. The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"direction four times not knowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall\\u2014which was already denuded of everything else that had been on it\\u2014of the lady dressed in copious fur. He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly. This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by no-one. He turned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they came\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters. After that, the three of them left the flat together, which was something they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the open country outside the town. They had the tram, filled with warm sunshine, all to themselves. Leant back comfortably on their seats, they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at all bad\\u2014until then they had never asked each other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in their favour. \\u201cI mean just what I said\\u201d, answered Mr. Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards the man. At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new positions. \\u201cAlright, we\\u2019ll go then\\u201d, he said, and looked up at Mr. Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision. Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"at all, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably. His observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on. If Gregor had only been\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him. At first she would call to him as she did so with words that she probably considered friendly, such as \\u201ccome on then, you old dung-beetle!\\u201d, or \\u201clook at the old dung-beetle there!\\u201d Gregor never responded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been opened. If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt like\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"because of him, might be near to death; he could not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had to stay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about, he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table. He lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was quiet, maybe that\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his room as quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway. What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o\\u2019clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all around the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor\\u2019s father into a panic as well. Until then he had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running after the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him, Gregor\\u2019s father seized the chief clerk\\u2019s stick in his right hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his hat and overcoat), picked up a large\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"next door and they would all go silent. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that he\\u2019s doing now\\u201d, his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again. When explaining things, his father repeated himself several times, partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these matters himself and partly because Gregor\\u2019s mother did not understand everything the first time. From these repeated explanations Gregor learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"condition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening. He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the living room, he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table and listen to their conversation\\u2014with everyone\\u2019s permission, in a way, and thus quite differently from before. They no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of course, the ones\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to hiss and spit at the attackers; his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of her own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about it last Christmas\\u2014had Christmas really come and gone already?\\u2014if this misfortune hadn\\u2019t got in the way, and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it. On hearing all this, his sister would break out in tears of emotion,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"Samsa!\\u201d, shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor\\u2019s father, pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at Gregor as he slowly moved forward. The violin went silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor. His father seemed to think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing had been. He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet. \\u201cSomething\\u2019s fallen down in there\\u201d, said the chief clerk in the room on the left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you had to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this question, the chief clerk\\u2019s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right, Gregor\\u2019s sister whispered to him\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"no room for anywhere else, and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen. These earnest gentlemen\\u2014all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door one day\\u2014were painfully insistent on things\\u2019 being tidy. This meant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room in this establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen. Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate, especially if it was dirty. They had moreover brought most of\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him. \\u201cSeven o\\u2019clock, already\\u201d, he said to himself when the clock struck again, \\u201cseven o\\u2019clock, and there\\u2019s still a fog like this.\\u201d And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state. But then he said to himself: \\u201cBefore it strikes quarter past seven\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"don\\u2019t know why I didn\\u2019t let you know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home. Please, don\\u2019t make my parents suffer! There\\u2019s no basis for any of the accusations you\\u2019re making; nobody\\u2019s ever said a word to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven\\u2019t read the latest contracts I sent in. I\\u2019ll set off with the eight o\\u2019clock train, as well, these few hours of rest have given me strength. You don\\u2019t need to wait, sir; I\\u2019ll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"to have placed it\\u2014out of the way in a corner. His sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention, one on each side, to the movements of her hands. Drawn in by the playing, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in the living room. Before, he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others. What\\u2019s more, there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"it, although there was no longer much warm affection given in return. Gregor only remained close to his sister now. Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some other way. During Gregor\\u2019s short periods in town, conversation with his sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised. Their parents did\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"at all, either night or day. Sometimes he would think of taking over the family\\u2019s affairs, just like before, the next time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow,\\u2014all of them appeared to him, mixed together with\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"been new to start with, but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor\\u2019s mother and sister to look after it. Gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny, while the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful. As soon as it struck ten, Gregor\\u2019s mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he couldn\\u2019t sleep properly where he was and he\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"for eight o\\u2019clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"finished before Gregor\\u2019s father got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another thing it wasn\\u2019t even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him. She thought just the opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn\\u2019t Gregor feel the same way about it, he\\u2019d been used to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that. Then, quietly,\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"was nearly a miracle that only one of them had been\\u2014and dragged along lifelessly. It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of something to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. He was so pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been that morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly covering his eyes with it. But he soon\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"doing this, but doing it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced, as what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day, even things that were quite near; he had used to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each, individual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: \\u201cGregor, open the door, I beg of you.\\u201d Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home. The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only then\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder. Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor\\u2019s mother had pulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor\\u2019s father as he drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Gregor had\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"ask for help from her father; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless it was especially important; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when Gregor\\u2019s father was not there and fetch his mother to help her. As she approached the room, Gregor could hear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"know: \\u201cGregor, the chief clerk is here.\\u201d \\u201cYes, I know\\u201d, said Gregor to himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him. \\u201cGregor\\u201d, said his father now from the room to his left, \\u201cthe chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn\\u2019t leave on the early train. We don\\u2019t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to speak to you personally. So please open up this door. I\\u2019m sure he\\u2019ll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.\\u201d Then the chief clerk called \\u201cGood\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"when his sister arrived as a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it. At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood\\u2014cleaning up Gregor\\u2019s room was for her and her alone. Gregor\\u2019s mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do it\\u2014although that much dampness also made\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"paleness of her face seemed to confirm this. \\u201cDead?\\u201d, asked Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly, even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it even without checking. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what I said\\u201d, replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor\\u2019s body another shove with the broom, sending it sideways across the floor. Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete it. \\u201cNow then\\u201d, said Mr. Samsa, \\u201clet\\u2019s give thanks to God for that\\u201d. He crossed himself, and the three women followed his example.\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation. She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted to help too\\u2014he could save his picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he, too, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; she was looking\"],\n [\"c\",\n\"father got home and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way even more, and for another thing it wasn\\u2019t even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him. She thought just the opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart; and why wouldn\\u2019t Gregor feel the same way about it, he\\u2019d been used to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that. Then, quietly, almost whispering as\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"schoolroom piano broke into all gruesome fancies; and when that failed there were confabulations in corners, with a sequel of one of them going out in the highest spirits in order to \\u201ccome in\\u201d as something new. I had had brothers myself, and it was no revelation to me that little girls could be slavish idolaters of little boys. What surpassed everything was that there was a little boy in the world who could have for the inferior age, sex, and intelligence so fine a consideration. They were extraordinarily at one, and to say that they never either quarreled or\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"say I\\u2019ve not been awfully good, can you?\\u201d I laid my hand on his shoulder, for, though I felt how much better it would have been to walk on, I was not yet quite able. \\u201cNo, I can\\u2019t say that, Miles.\\u201d \\u201cExcept just that one night, you know\\u2014!\\u201d \\u201cThat one night?\\u201d I couldn\\u2019t look as straight as he. \\u201cWhy, when I went down\\u2014went out of the house.\\u201d \\u201cOh, yes. But I forget what you did it for.\\u201d \\u201cYou forget?\\u201d\\u2014he spoke with the sweet extravagance of childish reproach. \\u201cWhy, it was to show you I could!\\u201d \\u201cOh, yes, you could.\\u201d \\u201cAnd\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"turn of the screw, what do you say to two children\\u2014?\\u201d \\u201cWe say, of course,\\u201d somebody exclaimed, \\u201cthat they give two turns! Also that we want to hear about them.\\u201d I can see Douglas there before the fire, to which he had got up to present his back, looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets. \\u201cNobody but me, till now, has ever heard. It\\u2019s quite too horrible.\\u201d This, naturally, was declared by several voices to give the thing the utmost price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his triumph by turning his eyes over the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"likes!\\u2019\\u201d \\u201cI wish indeed he would. And what did Flora say?\\u201d \\u201cMiss Flora was too sweet. She said, \\u2018Oh, of course, of course!\\u2019\\u2014and I said the same.\\u201d I thought a moment. \\u201cYou were too sweet, too\\u2014I can hear you all. But nonetheless, between Miles and me, it\\u2019s now all out.\\u201d \\u201cAll out?\\u201d My companion stared. \\u201cBut what, miss?\\u201d \\u201cEverything. It doesn\\u2019t matter. I\\u2019ve made up my mind. I came home, my dear,\\u201d I went on, \\u201cfor a talk with Miss Jessel.\\u201d I had by this time formed the habit of having Mrs. Grose literally well in hand in advance of\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"us a little longer suspended and unbruised. \\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you everything,\\u201d Miles said\\u2014\\u201cI mean I\\u2019ll tell you anything you like. You\\u2019ll stay on with me, and we shall both be all right, and I will tell you\\u2014I will. But not now.\\u201d \\u201cWhy not now?\\u201d My insistence turned him from me and kept him once more at his window in a silence during which, between us, you might have heard a pin drop. Then he was before me again with the air of a person for whom, outside, someone who had frankly to be reckoned with was waiting. \\u201cI have to\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"quite fixed, reprobation. I was by this time\\u2014if I can put the whole thing at all together\\u2014more appalled at what I may properly call her manner than at anything else, though it was simultaneously with this that I became aware of having Mrs. Grose also, and very formidably, to reckon with. My elder companion, the next moment, at any rate, blotted out everything but her own flushed face and her loud, shocked protest, a burst of high disapproval. \\u201cWhat a dreadful turn, to be sure, miss! Where on earth do you see anything?\\u201d I could only grasp her more quickly\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I considered. \\u201cDid he put that to you as a justification?\\u201d At this she dropped again. \\u201cNo, he never spoke of it.\\u201d \\u201cNever mentioned her in connection with Quint?\\u201d She saw, visibly flushing, where I was coming out. \\u201cWell, he didn\\u2019t show anything. He denied,\\u201d she repeated; \\u201che denied.\\u201d Lord, how I pressed her now! \\u201cSo that you could see he knew what was between the two wretches?\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t know\\u2014I don\\u2019t know!\\u201d the poor woman groaned. \\u201cYou do know, you dear thing,\\u201d I replied; \\u201conly you haven\\u2019t my dreadful boldness of mind, and you keep back, out of timidity\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"children perpetually bowed over and hugged. The homage of which they were so lavish succeeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if I never appeared to myself, as I may say, literally to catch them at a purpose in it. They had never, I think, wanted to do so many things for their poor protectress; I mean\\u2014though they got their lessons better and better, which was naturally what would please her most\\u2014in the way of diverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading her passages, telling her stories, acting her charades, pouncing out at her, in disguises, as animals and\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"children to be given to something from which I was barred, I sufficiently obeyed my habit of being prepared for the worst. But an extraordinary impression dropped on me as I extracted a meaning from the boy\\u2019s embarrassed back\\u2014none other than the impression that I was not barred now. This inference grew in a few minutes to sharp intensity and seemed bound up with the direct perception that it was positively he who was. The frames and squares of the great window were a kind of image, for him, of a kind of failure. I felt that I saw him,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"as the hour for my drive approached, I cropped up in another place. \\u201cWhat was the lady who was here before?\\u201d \\u201cThe last governess? She was also young and pretty\\u2014almost as young and almost as pretty, miss, even as you.\\u201d \\u201cAh, then, I hope her youth and her beauty helped her!\\u201d I recollect throwing off. \\u201cHe seems to like us young and pretty!\\u201d \\u201cOh, he did,\\u201d Mrs. Grose assented: \\u201cit was the way he liked everyone!\\u201d She had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught herself up. \\u201cI mean that\\u2019s his way\\u2014the master\\u2019s.\\u201d I was struck. \\u201cBut of whom did\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the child\\u2019s face now received it fairly likened my breach of the silence to the smash of a pane of glass. It added to the interposing cry, as if to stay the blow, that Mrs. Grose, at the same instant, uttered over my violence\\u2014the shriek of a creature scared, or rather wounded, which, in turn, within a few seconds, was completed by a gasp of my own. I seized my colleague\\u2019s arm. \\u201cShe\\u2019s there, she\\u2019s there!\\u201d Miss Jessel stood before us on the opposite bank exactly as she had stood the other time, and I remember, strangely, as the first\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"that, as the prospect grew sharp to me, I at last let myself go. I got, so far as the immediate moment was concerned, away; I came straight out of the churchyard and, thinking hard, retraced my steps through the park. It seemed to me that by the time I reached the house I had made up my mind I would fly. The Sunday stillness both of the approaches and of the interior, in which I met no one, fairly excited me with a sense of opportunity. Were I to get off quickly, this way, I should get off without\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"to get her away. Far from this,\\u201d she pursued, \\u201cfar from them\\u2014\\u201d \\u201cShe may be different? She may be free?\\u201d I seized her almost with joy. \\u201cThen, in spite of yesterday, you believe\\u2014\\u201d \\u201cIn such doings?\\u201d Her simple description of them required, in the light of her expression, to be carried no further, and she gave me the whole thing as she had never done. \\u201cI believe.\\u201d Yes, it was a joy, and we were still shoulder to shoulder: if I might continue sure of that I should care but little what else happened. My support in the presence of\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"cried in a way that made my friend stare. \\u201cThere are directions in which I must not for the present let myself go.\\u201d Meanwhile I returned to her first example\\u2014the one to which she had just previously referred\\u2014of the boy\\u2019s happy capacity for an occasional slip. \\u201cIf Quint\\u2014on your remonstrance at the time you speak of\\u2014was a base menial, one of the things Miles said to you, I find myself guessing, was that you were another.\\u201d Again her admission was so adequate that I continued: \\u201cAnd you forgave him that?\\u201d \\u201cWouldn\\u2019t you?\\u201d \\u201cOh, yes!\\u201d And we exchanged there, in the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"sinecure. I forget what I was on the present occasion; I only remember that I was something very important and very quiet and that Flora was playing very hard. We were on the edge of the lake, and, as we had lately begun geography, the lake was the Sea of Azof. Suddenly, in these circumstances, I became aware that, on the other side of the Sea of Azof, we had an interested spectator. The way this knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in the world\\u2014the strangest, that is, except the very much stranger in which it quickly merged\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the poor woman burst into tears. A rigid control, from the next day, was, as I have said, to follow them; yet how often and how passionately, for a week, we came back together to the subject! Much as we had discussed it that Sunday night, I was, in the immediate later hours in especial\\u2014for it may be imagined whether I slept\\u2014still haunted with the shadow of something she had not told me. I myself had kept back nothing, but there was a word Mrs. Grose had kept back. I was sure, moreover, by morning, that this was not from\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the assumption on which my action had been founded; but what he finally said was: \\u201cDo you mean now\\u2014here?\\u201d \\u201cThere couldn\\u2019t be a better place or time.\\u201d He looked round him uneasily, and I had the rare\\u2014oh, the queer!\\u2014impression of the very first symptom I had seen in him of the approach of immediate fear. It was as if he were suddenly afraid of me\\u2014which struck me indeed as perhaps the best thing to make him. Yet in the very pang of the effort I felt it vain to try sternness, and I heard myself the next instant so gentle\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"visitant, at all events\\u2014and there was a touch of the strange freedom, as I remember, in the sign of familiarity of his wearing no hat\\u2014seemed to fix me, from his position, with just the question, just the scrutiny through the fading light, that his own presence provoked. We were too far apart to call to each other, but there was a moment at which, at shorter range, some challenge between us, breaking the hush, would have been the right result of our straight mutual stare. He was in one of the angles, the one away from the house, very erect,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"him, on the instant, without and within, in the great glow of freshness, the same positive fragrance of purity, in which I had, from the first moment, seen his little sister. He was incredibly beautiful, and Mrs. Grose had put her finger on it: everything but a sort of passion of tenderness for him was swept away by his presence. What I then and there took him to my heart for was something divine that I have never found to the same degree in any child\\u2014his indescribable little air of knowing nothing in the world but love. It would have\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I think you\\u2019re cruel. I don\\u2019t like you!\\u201d Then, after this deliverance, which might have been that of a vulgarly pert little girl in the street, she hugged Mrs. Grose more closely and buried in her skirts the dreadful little face. In this position she produced an almost furious wail. \\u201cTake me away, take me away\\u2014oh, take me away from her!\\u201d \\u201cFrom me?\\u201d I panted. \\u201cFrom you\\u2014from you!\\u201d she cried. Even Mrs. Grose looked across at me dismayed, while I had nothing to do but communicate again with the figure that, on the opposite bank, without a movement, as rigidly\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"them?\\u201d He evidently tried to remember, but it dropped\\u2014he had lost it. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know!\\u201d He almost smiled at me in the desolation of his surrender, which was indeed practically, by this time, so complete that I ought to have left it there. But I was infatuated\\u2014I was blind with victory, though even then the very effect that was to have brought him so much nearer was already that of added separation. \\u201cWas it to everyone?\\u201d I asked. \\u201cNo; it was only to\\u2014\\u201d But he gave a sick little headshake. \\u201cI don\\u2019t remember their names.\\u201d \\u201cWere they then so many?\\u201d\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"down. I burst, as I had, the other time, made her burst, into tears; she took me to her motherly breast, and my lamentation overflowed. \\u201cI don\\u2019t do it!\\u201d I sobbed in despair; \\u201cI don\\u2019t save or shield them! It\\u2019s far worse than I dreamed\\u2014they\\u2019re lost!\\u201d What I had said to Mrs. Grose was true enough: there were in the matter I had put before her depths and possibilities that I lacked resolution to sound; so that when we met once more in the wonder of it we were of a common mind about the duty of resistance to extravagant\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"know what I don\\u2019t see\\u2014what I don\\u2019t fear!\\u201d Mrs. Grose tried to keep up with me. \\u201cYou mean you\\u2019re afraid of seeing her again?\\u201d \\u201cOh, no; that\\u2019s nothing\\u2014now!\\u201d Then I explained. \\u201cIt\\u2019s of not seeing her.\\u201d But my companion only looked wan. \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand you.\\u201d \\u201cWhy, it\\u2019s that the child may keep it up\\u2014and that the child assuredly will\\u2014without my knowing it.\\u201d At the image of this possibility Mrs. Grose for a moment collapsed, yet presently to pull herself together again, as if from the positive force of the sense of what, should we yield an inch, there would\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"had counted on what it would give me to find myself alone with Miles, I speedily perceived, at least, that it would give me a measure. No hour of my stay in fact was so assailed with apprehensions as that of my coming down to learn that the carriage containing Mrs. Grose and my younger pupil had already rolled out of the gates. Now I was, I said to myself, face to face with the elements, and for much of the rest of the day, while I fought my weakness, I could consider that I had been supremely rash. It\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the art I now need to make it a little distinct. What I look back at with amazement is the situation I accepted. I had undertaken, with my companion, to see it out, and I was under a charm, apparently, that could smooth away the extent and the far and difficult connections of such an effort. I was lifted aloft on a great wave of infatuation and pity. I found it simple, in my ignorance, my confusion, and perhaps my conceit, to assume that I could deal with a boy whose education for the world was all on the point\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"pinch of that, I found I had only to ask her how, if I had \\u201cmade it up,\\u201d I came to be able to give, of each of the persons appearing to me, a picture disclosing, to the last detail, their special marks\\u2014a portrait on the exhibition of which she had instantly recognized and named them. She wished of course\\u2014small blame to her!\\u2014to sink the whole subject; and I was quick to assure her that my own interest in it had now violently taken the form of a search for the way to escape from it. I encountered her on\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I had made of the fact that this name had never once, between us, been sounded, the quick, smitten glare with which the child\\u2019s face now received it fairly likened my breach of the silence to the smash of a pane of glass. It added to the interposing cry, as if to stay the blow, that Mrs. Grose, at the same instant, uttered over my violence\\u2014the shriek of a creature scared, or rather wounded, which, in turn, within a few seconds, was completed by a gasp of my own. I seized my colleague\\u2019s arm. \\u201cShe\\u2019s there, she\\u2019s there!\\u201d Miss Jessel\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"would not involve something of a sacrifice of my employer. Yet it appeared to me that we were all, at Bly, sufficiently sacrificed to make that venial. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think your uncle much cares.\\u201d Miles, on this, stood looking at me. \\u201cThen don\\u2019t you think he can be made to?\\u201d \\u201cIn what way?\\u201d \\u201cWhy, by his coming down.\\u201d \\u201cBut who\\u2019ll get him to come down?\\u201d \\u201cI will!\\u201d the boy said with extraordinary brightness and emphasis. He gave me another look charged with that expression and then marched off alone into church. The business was practically settled from the moment I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"said\\u2014\\u201cI mean I\\u2019ll tell you anything you like. You\\u2019ll stay on with me, and we shall both be all right, and I will tell you\\u2014I will. But not now.\\u201d \\u201cWhy not now?\\u201d My insistence turned him from me and kept him once more at his window in a silence during which, between us, you might have heard a pin drop. Then he was before me again with the air of a person for whom, outside, someone who had frankly to be reckoned with was waiting. \\u201cI have to see Luke.\\u201d I had not yet reduced him to quite so vulgar\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"summer. I was much there that year\\u2014it was a beautiful one; and we had, in her off-hours, some strolls and talks in the garden\\u2014talks in which she struck me as awfully clever and nice. Oh yes; don\\u2019t grin: I liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think she liked me, too. If she hadn\\u2019t she wouldn\\u2019t have told me. She had never told anyone. It wasn\\u2019t simply that she said so, but that I knew she hadn\\u2019t. I was sure; I could see. You\\u2019ll easily judge why when you hear.\\u201d \\u201cBecause the thing had been such a\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"blank; the effect of which on my nerves was an aggravation until I saw the necessity of making it a positive aid. It was precisely, in short, by just clutching the helm that I avoided total wreck; and I dare say that, to bear up at all, I became, that morning, very grand and very dry. I welcomed the consciousness that I was charged with much to do, and I caused it to be known as well that, left thus to myself, I was quite remarkably firm. I wandered with that manner, for the next hour or two, all over\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"to offer my pupils and the rest of the congregation such an example of delay. What I said to myself above all was that Miles had got something out of me and that the proof of it, for him, would be just this awkward collapse. He had got out of me that there was something I was much afraid of and that he should probably be able to make use of my fear to gain, for his own purpose, more freedom. My fear was of having to deal with the intolerable question of the grounds of his dismissal from school,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"raising them, \\u201cTell me how you know,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThen you admit it\\u2019s what she was?\\u201d I cried. \\u201cTell me how you know,\\u201d my friend simply repeated. \\u201cKnow? By seeing her! By the way she looked.\\u201d \\u201cAt you, do you mean\\u2014so wickedly?\\u201d \\u201cDear me, no\\u2014I could have borne that. She gave me never a glance. She only fixed the child.\\u201d Mrs. Grose tried to see it. \\u201cFixed her?\\u201d \\u201cAh, with such awful eyes!\\u201d She stared at mine as if they might really have resembled them. \\u201cDo you mean of dislike?\\u201d \\u201cGod help us, no. Of something much worse.\\u201d \\u201cWorse than\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"about me. \\u201cCertainly. But you won\\u2019t.\\u201d \\u201cNo, not that again. It was nothing.\\u201d \\u201cIt was nothing,\\u201d I said. \\u201cBut we must go on.\\u201d He resumed our walk with me, passing his hand into my arm. \\u201cThen when am I going back?\\u201d I wore, in turning it over, my most responsible air. \\u201cWere you very happy at school?\\u201d He just considered. \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m happy enough anywhere!\\u201d \\u201cWell, then,\\u201d I quavered, \\u201cif you\\u2019re just as happy here\\u2014!\\u201d \\u201cAh, but that isn\\u2019t everything! Of course you know a lot\\u2014\\u201d \\u201cBut you hint that you know almost as much?\\u201d I risked as he paused.\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"which I could still watch it, see it fix successively several other things. On the spot there came to me the added shock of a certitude that it was not for me he had come there. He had come for someone else. The flash of this knowledge\\u2014for it was knowledge in the midst of dread\\u2014produced in me the most extraordinary effect, started as I stood there, a sudden vibration of duty and courage. I say courage because I was beyond all doubt already far gone. I bounded straight out of the door again, reached that of the house, got, in\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"away from me had I not been prepared. I still held her there, to show I was. \\u201cAs I\\u2019ve told you, however, it doesn\\u2019t matter.\\u201d \\u201cBecause you\\u2019ve made up your mind? But to what?\\u201d \\u201cTo everything.\\u201d \\u201cAnd what do you call \\u2018everything\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cWhy, sending for their uncle.\\u201d \\u201cOh, miss, in pity do,\\u201d my friend broke out. \\u201cah, but I will, I will! I see it\\u2019s the only way. What\\u2019s \\u2018out,\\u2019 as I told you, with Miles is that if he thinks I\\u2019m afraid to\\u2014and has ideas of what he gains by that\\u2014he shall see he\\u2019s mistaken. Yes, yes; his uncle\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"with Miles and Flora, and through nothing could I so like it as through feeling that I could throw myself into it in trouble. The attraction of my small charges was a constant joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original fears, the distaste I had begun by entertaining for the probable gray prose of my office. There was to be no gray prose, it appeared, and no long grind; so how could work not be charming that presented itself as daily beauty? It was all the romance of the nursery and the poetry of the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"of our consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural timidity. In spite of this timidity\\u2014which the child herself, in the oddest way in the world, had been perfectly frank and brave about, allowing it, without a sign of uncomfortable consciousness, with the deep, sweet serenity indeed of one of Raphael\\u2019s holy infants, to be discussed, to be imputed to her, and to determine us\\u2014I feel quite sure she would presently like me. It was part of what I already liked Mrs. Grose herself for, the pleasure I could see her feel in my admiration and wonder as I sat\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"Yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of applying them, the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home to me by the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as yet, for the eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow. To mark, for the house, the high state I cultivated I decreed that my meals with the boy should be served, as we called it, downstairs; so that I had been awaiting him in the ponderous pomp of the room outside of the window of which I had had from Mrs. Grose, that first scared Sunday, my\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"you might think. One had seen it coming on.\\u201d \\u201cThen why didn\\u2019t you get her off before?\\u201d \\u201cBefore what?\\u201d \\u201cBefore she became too ill to travel.\\u201d I found myself prompt. \\u201cShe\\u2019s not too ill to travel: she only might have become so if she had stayed. This was just the moment to seize. The journey will dissipate the influence\\u201d\\u2014oh, I was grand!\\u2014\\u201cand carry it off.\\u201d \\u201cI see, I see\\u201d\\u2014Miles, for that matter, was grand, too. He settled to his repast with the charming little \\u201ctable manner\\u201d that, from the day of his arrival, had relieved me of all grossness of\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"my discrimination. \\u201cI daresay I was wrong. But, really, I was afraid.\\u201d \\u201cAfraid of what?\\u201d \\u201cOf things that man could do. Quint was so clever\\u2014he was so deep.\\u201d I took this in still more than, probably, I showed. \\u201cYou weren\\u2019t afraid of anything else? Not of his effect\\u2014?\\u201d \\u201cHis effect?\\u201d she repeated with a face of anguish and waiting while I faltered. \\u201cOn innocent little precious lives. They were in your charge.\\u201d \\u201cNo, they were not in mine!\\u201d she roundly and distressfully returned. \\u201cThe master believed in him and placed him here because he was supposed not to be well\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"face, framed in its smooth whiteness, made him for the minute as appealing as some wistful patient in a children\\u2019s hospital; and I would have given, as the resemblance came to me, all I possessed on earth really to be the nurse or the sister of charity who might have helped to cure him. Well, even as it was, I perhaps might help! \\u201cDo you know you\\u2019ve never said a word to me about your school\\u2014I mean the old one; never mentioned it in any way?\\u201d He seemed to wonder; he smiled with the same loveliness. But he clearly gained\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the pew and of the almost spiritual help of the hassock on which I might bend my knees. I seemed literally to be running a race with some confusion to which he was about to reduce me, but I felt that he had got in first when, before we had even entered the churchyard, he threw out\\u2014 \\u201cI want my own sort!\\u201d It literally made me bound forward. \\u201cThere are not many of your own sort, Miles!\\u201d I laughed. \\u201cUnless perhaps dear little Flora!\\u201d \\u201cYou really compare me to a baby girl?\\u201d This found me singularly weak. \\u201cDon\\u2019t you, then,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"more or less noise that at the moment we might be engaged in making and that I could hear through any deepened exhilaration or quickened recitation or louder strum of the piano. Then it was that the others, the outsiders, were there. Though they were not angels, they \\u201cpassed,\\u201d as the French say, causing me, while they stayed, to tremble with the fear of their addressing to their younger victims some yet more infernal message or more vivid image than they had thought good enough for myself. What it was most impossible to get rid of was the cruel idea\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"over the place and looked, I have no doubt, as if I were ready for any onset. So, for the benefit of whom it might concern, I paraded with a sick heart. The person it appeared least to concern proved to be, till dinner, little Miles himself. My perambulations had given me, meanwhile, no glimpse of him, but they had tended to make more public the change taking place in our relation as a consequence of his having at the piano, the day before, kept me, in Flora\\u2019s interest, so beguiled and befooled. The stamp of publicity had of course\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"fairly so appraised it I saw how the human soul\\u2014held out, in the tremor of my hands, at arm\\u2019s length\\u2014had a perfect dew of sweat on a lovely childish forehead. The face that was close to mine was as white as the face against the glass, and out of it presently came a sound, not low nor weak, but as if from much further away, that I drank like a waft of fragrance. \\u201cYes\\u2014I took it.\\u201d At this, with a moan of joy, I enfolded, I drew him close; and while I held him to my breast, where I could\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"do something,\\u201d I conceded. \\u201cBut, you know, you didn\\u2019t do it.\\u201d \\u201cOh, yes,\\u201d he said with the brightest superficial eagerness, \\u201cyou wanted me to tell you something.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s it. Out, straight out. What you have on your mind, you know.\\u201d \\u201cAh, then, is that what you\\u2019ve stayed over for?\\u201d He spoke with a gaiety through which I could still catch the finest little quiver of resentful passion; but I can\\u2019t begin to express the effect upon me of an implication of surrender even so faint. It was as if what I had yearned for had come at last only to\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"again. \\u201cIsn\\u2019t anybody going?\\u201d It was almost the tone of hope. \\u201cEverybody will stay!\\u201d \\u201cI will\\u201d\\u2014and \\u201cI will!\\u201d cried the ladies whose departure had been fixed. Mrs. Griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more light. \\u201cWho was it she was in love with?\\u201d \\u201cThe story will tell,\\u201d I took upon myself to reply. \\u201cOh, I can\\u2019t wait for the story!\\u201d \\u201cThe story won\\u2019t tell,\\u201d said Douglas; \\u201cnot in any literal, vulgar way.\\u201d \\u201cMore\\u2019s the pity, then. That\\u2019s the only way I ever understand.\\u201d \\u201cWon\\u2019t you tell, Douglas?\\u201d somebody else inquired. He sprang to his feet again. \\u201cYes\\u2014tomorrow. Now\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"that it was better still than that. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not Miss Jessel! But it\\u2019s at the window\\u2014straight before us. It\\u2019s there\\u2014the coward horror, there for the last time!\\u201d At this, after a second in which his head made the movement of a baffled dog\\u2019s on a scent and then gave a frantic little shake for air and light, he was at me in a white rage, bewildered, glaring vainly over the place and missing wholly, though it now, to my sense, filled the room like the taste of poison, the wide, overwhelming presence. \\u201cIt\\u2019s he?\\u201d I was so determined to have\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"he thinks I\\u2019m afraid to\\u2014and has ideas of what he gains by that\\u2014he shall see he\\u2019s mistaken. Yes, yes; his uncle shall have it here from me on the spot (and before the boy himself, if necessary) that if I\\u2019m to be reproached with having done nothing again about more school\\u2014\\u201d \\u201cYes, miss\\u2014\\u201d my companion pressed me. \\u201cWell, there\\u2019s that awful reason.\\u201d There were now clearly so many of these for my poor colleague that she was excusable for being vague. \\u201cBut\\u2014a\\u2014which?\\u201d \\u201cWhy, the letter from his old place.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019ll show it to the master?\\u201d \\u201cI ought to have done\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"He laughed for the first time. \\u201cYou are acute. Yes, she was in love. That is, she had been. That came out\\u2014she couldn\\u2019t tell her story without its coming out. I saw it, and she saw I saw it; but neither of us spoke of it. I remember the time and the place\\u2014the corner of the lawn, the shade of the great beeches and the long, hot summer afternoon. It wasn\\u2019t a scene for a shudder; but oh\\u2014!\\u201d He quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair. \\u201cYou\\u2019ll receive the packet Thursday morning?\\u201d I inquired. \\u201cProbably not till the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"to do with the restlessness that, before morning, made me several times rise and wander about my room to take in the whole picture and prospect; to watch, from my open window, the faint summer dawn, to look at such portions of the rest of the house as I could catch, and to listen, while, in the fading dusk, the first birds began to twitter, for the possible recurrence of a sound or two, less natural and not without, but within, that I had fancied I heard. There had been a moment when I believed I recognized, faint and far,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"prepared for to keep terms with so compromising a contract. I was queer company enough\\u2014quite as queer as the company I received; but as I trace over what we went through I see how much common ground we must have found in the one idea that, by good fortune, could steady us. It was the idea, the second movement, that led me straight out, as I may say, of the inner chamber of my dread. I could take the air in the court, at least, and there Mrs. Grose could join me. Perfectly can I recall now the particular way\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"Good night.\\u201d And quickly catching up a candlestick, he left us slightly bewildered. From our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on the stair; whereupon Mrs. Griffin spoke. \\u201cWell, if I don\\u2019t know who she was in love with, I know who he was.\\u201d \\u201cShe was ten years older,\\u201d said her husband. \\u201cRaison de plus\\u2014at that age! But it\\u2019s rather nice, his long reticence.\\u201d \\u201cForty years!\\u201d Griffin put in. \\u201cWith this outbreak at last.\\u201d \\u201cThe outbreak,\\u201d I returned, \\u201cwill make a tremendous occasion of Thursday night;\\u201d and everyone so agreed with me that, in the light\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"nurse or the sister of charity who might have helped to cure him. Well, even as it was, I perhaps might help! \\u201cDo you know you\\u2019ve never said a word to me about your school\\u2014I mean the old one; never mentioned it in any way?\\u201d He seemed to wonder; he smiled with the same loveliness. But he clearly gained time; he waited, he called for guidance. \\u201cHaven\\u2019t I?\\u201d It wasn\\u2019t for me to help him\\u2014it was for the thing I had met! Something in his tone and the expression of his face, as I got this from him, set my\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"approached, I cropped up in another place. \\u201cWhat was the lady who was here before?\\u201d \\u201cThe last governess? She was also young and pretty\\u2014almost as young and almost as pretty, miss, even as you.\\u201d \\u201cAh, then, I hope her youth and her beauty helped her!\\u201d I recollect throwing off. \\u201cHe seems to like us young and pretty!\\u201d \\u201cOh, he did,\\u201d Mrs. Grose assented: \\u201cit was the way he liked everyone!\\u201d She had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught herself up. \\u201cI mean that\\u2019s his way\\u2014the master\\u2019s.\\u201d I was struck. \\u201cBut of whom did you speak first?\\u201d She looked blank,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"corridors, on crooked staircases that made me pause and even on the summit of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy, her morning music, her disposition to tell me so many more things than she asked, rang out and led me on. I have not seen Bly since the day I left it, and I daresay that to my older and more informed eyes it would now appear sufficiently contracted. But as my little conductress, with her hair of gold and her frock of blue, danced before me round corners and pattered down passages, I had the view\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"\\u201cYes, yes; it would be incredible.\\u201d She was evidently grateful for such a profession. \\u201cSee him, miss, first. Then believe it!\\u201d I felt forthwith a new impatience to see him; it was the beginning of a curiosity that, for all the next hours, was to deepen almost to pain. Mrs. Grose was aware, I could judge, of what she had produced in me, and she followed it up with assurance. \\u201cYou might as well believe it of the little lady. Bless her,\\u201d she added the next moment\\u2014\\u201clook at her!\\u201d I turned and saw that Flora, whom, ten minutes before, I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"room and drew his breath, two or three times over, as if with difficulty. He might have been standing at the bottom of the sea and raising his eyes to some faint green twilight. \\u201cWell\\u2014I said things.\\u201d \\u201cOnly that?\\u201d \\u201cThey thought it was enough!\\u201d \\u201cTo turn you out for?\\u201d Never, truly, had a person \\u201cturned out\\u201d shown so little to explain it as this little person! He appeared to weigh my question, but in a manner quite detached and almost helpless. \\u201cWell, I suppose I oughtn\\u2019t.\\u201d \\u201cBut to whom did you say them?\\u201d He evidently tried to remember, but it\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"to the good. It only went indeed a little way. \\u201cBut if he isn\\u2019t a gentleman\\u2014\\u201d \\u201cWhat is he? He\\u2019s a horror.\\u201d \\u201cA horror?\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s\\u2014God help me if I know what he is!\\u201d Mrs. Grose looked round once more; she fixed her eyes on the duskier distance, then, pulling herself together, turned to me with abrupt inconsequence. \\u201cIt\\u2019s time we should be at church.\\u201d \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m not fit for church!\\u201d \\u201cWon\\u2019t it do you good?\\u201d \\u201cIt won\\u2019t do them!\\u2014 I nodded at the house. \\u201cThe children?\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t leave them now.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re afraid\\u2014?\\u201d I spoke boldly. \\u201cI\\u2019m afraid of him.\\u201d\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"of my hands, at arm\\u2019s length\\u2014had a perfect dew of sweat on a lovely childish forehead. The face that was close to mine was as white as the face against the glass, and out of it presently came a sound, not low nor weak, but as if from much further away, that I drank like a waft of fragrance. \\u201cYes\\u2014I took it.\\u201d At this, with a moan of joy, I enfolded, I drew him close; and while I held him to my breast, where I could feel in the sudden fever of his little body the tremendous pulse of his\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"had never for a second suffered. I took this as a direct disproof of his having really been chastised. If he had been wicked he would have \\u201ccaught\\u201d it, and I should have caught it by the rebound\\u2014I should have found the trace. I found nothing at all, and he was therefore an angel. He never spoke of his school, never mentioned a comrade or a master; and I, for my part, was quite too much disgusted to allude to them. Of course I was under the spell, and the wonderful part is that, even at the time, I perfectly\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"But how could you be sure I would know it?\\u201d \\u201cOh, I arranged that with Flora.\\u201d His answers rang out with a readiness! \\u201cShe was to get up and look out.\\u201d \\u201cWhich is what she did do.\\u201d It was I who fell into the trap! \\u201cSo she disturbed you, and, to see what she was looking at, you also looked\\u2014you saw.\\u201d \\u201cWhile you,\\u201d I concurred, \\u201ccaught your death in the night air!\\u201d He literally bloomed so from this exploit that he could afford radiantly to assent. \\u201cHow otherwise should I have been bad enough?\\u201d he asked. Then, after another embrace,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"today as I was sure then, my mere infernal imagination: it was absolutely traceable that they were aware of my predicament and that this strange relation made, in a manner, for a long time, the air in which we moved. I don\\u2019t mean that they had their tongues in their cheeks or did anything vulgar, for that was not one of their dangers: I do mean, on the other hand, that the element of the unnamed and untouched became, between us, greater than any other, and that so much avoidance could not have been so successfully effected without a great\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"agree with us for an early hearing; then I asked him if the experience in question had been his own. To this his answer was prompt. \\u201cOh, thank God, no!\\u201d \\u201cAnd is the record yours? You took the thing down?\\u201d \\u201cNothing but the impression. I took that here\\u201d\\u2014he tapped his heart. \\u201cI\\u2019ve never lost it.\\u201d \\u201cThen your manuscript\\u2014?\\u201d \\u201cIs in old, faded ink, and in the most beautiful hand.\\u201d He hung fire again. \\u201cA woman\\u2019s. She has been dead these twenty years. She sent me the pages in question before she died.\\u201d They were all listening now, and of course\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"that she wanted, by just so much as she did thus see, to make me suppose she didn\\u2019t, and at the same time, without showing anything, arrive at a guess as to whether I myself did! It was a pity that I needed once more to describe the portentous little activity by which she sought to divert my attention\\u2014the perceptible increase of movement, the greater intensity of play, the singing, the gabbling of nonsense, and the invitation to romp. Yet if I had not indulged, to prove there was nothing in it, in this review, I should have missed the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"my discipline. They had a delightful endless appetite for passages in my own history, to which I had again and again treated them; they were in possession of everything that had ever happened to me, had had, with every circumstance the story of my smallest adventures and of those of my brothers and sisters and of the cat and the dog at home, as well as many particulars of the eccentric nature of my father, of the furniture and arrangement of our house, and of the conversation of the old women of our village. There were things enough, taking one\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"eyebrows are, somehow, darker; they look particularly arched and as if they might move a good deal. His eyes are sharp, strange\\u2014awfully; but I only know clearly that they\\u2019re rather small and very fixed. His mouth\\u2019s wide, and his lips are thin, and except for his little whiskers he\\u2019s quite clean-shaven. He gives me a sort of sense of looking like an actor.\\u201d \\u201cAn actor!\\u201d It was impossible to resemble one less, at least, than Mrs. Grose at that moment. \\u201cI\\u2019ve never seen one, but so I suppose them. He\\u2019s tall, active, erect,\\u201d I continued, \\u201cbut never\\u2014no, never!\\u2014a gentleman.\\u201d My\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"Her thus turning her back on me was fortunately not, for my just preoccupations, a snub that could check the growth of our mutual esteem. We met, after I had brought home little Miles, more intimately than ever on the ground of my stupefaction, my general emotion: so monstrous was I then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now been revealed to me should be under an interdict. I was a little late on the scene, and I felt, as he stood wistfully looking out for me before the door of the inn at which the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"Did I look very queer?\\u201d \\u201cThrough this window? Dreadful!\\u201d \\u201cWell,\\u201d I said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve been frightened.\\u201d Mrs. Grose\\u2019s eyes expressed plainly that she had no wish to be, yet also that she knew too well her place not to be ready to share with me any marked inconvenience. Oh, it was quite settled that she must share! \\u201cJust what you saw from the dining room a minute ago was the effect of that. What I saw\\u2014just before\\u2014was much worse.\\u201d Her hand tightened. \\u201cWhat was it?\\u201d \\u201cAn extraordinary man. Looking in.\\u201d \\u201cWhat extraordinary man?\\u201d \\u201cI haven\\u2019t the least idea.\\u201d Mrs. Grose gazed\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"be in the face of what, in our prodigious experience, was least to be questioned. Late that night, while the house slept, we had another talk in my room, when she went all the way with me as to its being beyond doubt that I had seen exactly what I had seen. To hold her perfectly in the pinch of that, I found I had only to ask her how, if I had \\u201cmade it up,\\u201d I came to be able to give, of each of the persons appearing to me, a picture disclosing, to the last detail, their special\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"way I\\u2019m going on.\\u201d I perceived quickly enough that I could make, to this inquiry, no answer that would not involve something of a sacrifice of my employer. Yet it appeared to me that we were all, at Bly, sufficiently sacrificed to make that venial. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think your uncle much cares.\\u201d Miles, on this, stood looking at me. \\u201cThen don\\u2019t you think he can be made to?\\u201d \\u201cIn what way?\\u201d \\u201cWhy, by his coming down.\\u201d \\u201cBut who\\u2019ll get him to come down?\\u201d \\u201cI will!\\u201d the boy said with extraordinary brightness and emphasis. He gave me another look charged with\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"on which our hopes were fixed. Then he became as communicative as we could desire and indeed gave us his best reason for being so. We had it from him again before the fire in the hall, as we had had our mild wonders of the previous night. It appeared that the narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue. Let me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative, from an exact transcript of my own made much later, is what I shall presently give. Poor\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"when, looking out to see either Quint or Miss Jessel under the stars, I had beheld the boy over whose rest I watched and who had immediately brought in with him\\u2014had straightway, there, turned it on me\\u2014the lovely upward look with which, from the battlements above me, the hideous apparition of Quint had played. If it was a question of a scare, my discovery on this occasion had scared me more than any other, and it was in the condition of nerves produced by it that I made my actual inductions. They harassed me so that sometimes, at odd moments,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"mean now: you mean that\\u2014to be let alone yourself and not followed up\\u2014you\\u2019ll cease to worry and spy upon me, won\\u2019t keep me so close to you, will let me go and come. Well, I \\u2018come,\\u2019 you see\\u2014but I don\\u2019t go! There\\u2019ll be plenty of time for that. I do really delight in your society, and I only want to show you that I contended for a principle.\\u201d It may be imagined whether I resisted this appeal or failed to accompany him again, hand in hand, to the schoolroom. He sat down at the old piano and played as he\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"She saw me as I had seen my own visitant; she pulled up short as I had done; I gave her something of the shock that I had received. She turned white, and this made me ask myself if I had blanched as much. She stared, in short, and retreated on just my lines, and I knew she had then passed out and come round to me and that I should presently meet her. I remained where I was, and while I waited I thought of more things than one. But there\\u2019s only one I take space to mention. I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"with which, in these days, I overscored their full hours. They had shown me from the first a facility for everything, a general faculty which, taking a fresh start, achieved remarkable flights. They got their little tasks as if they loved them, and indulged, from the mere exuberance of the gift, in the most unimposed little miracles of memory. They not only popped out at me as tigers and as Romans, but as Shakespeareans, astronomers, and navigators. This was so singularly the case that it had presumably much to do with the fact as to which, at the present day,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"quavered, \\u201cif you\\u2019re just as happy here\\u2014!\\u201d \\u201cAh, but that isn\\u2019t everything! Of course you know a lot\\u2014\\u201d \\u201cBut you hint that you know almost as much?\\u201d I risked as he paused. \\u201cNot half I want to!\\u201d Miles honestly professed. \\u201cBut it isn\\u2019t so much that.\\u201d \\u201cWhat is it, then?\\u201d \\u201cWell\\u2014I want to see more life.\\u201d \\u201cI see; I see.\\u201d We had arrived within sight of the church and of various persons, including several of the household of Bly, on their way to it and clustered about the door to see us go in. I quickened our step; I wanted\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"he has lost you forever!\\u201d Then, for the demonstration of my work, \\u201cThere, there!\\u201d I said to Miles. But he had already jerked straight round, stared, glared again, and seen but the quiet day. With the stroke of the loss I was so proud of he uttered the cry of a creature hurled over an abyss, and the grasp with which I recovered him might have been that of catching him in his fall. I caught him, yes, I held him\\u2014it may be imagined with what a passion; but at the end of a minute I began to feel what\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"said shortly before to Mrs. Grose that she was not at these times a child, but an old, old woman, and that description of her could not have been more strikingly confirmed than in the way in which, for all answer to this, she simply showed me, without a concession, an admission, of her eyes, a countenance of deeper and deeper, of indeed suddenly quite fixed, reprobation. I was by this time\\u2014if I can put the whole thing at all together\\u2014more appalled at what I may properly call her manner than at anything else, though it was simultaneously with this\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I pressed my interlocutress. \\u201cI promise you I would have told!\\u201d She felt my discrimination. \\u201cI daresay I was wrong. But, really, I was afraid.\\u201d \\u201cAfraid of what?\\u201d \\u201cOf things that man could do. Quint was so clever\\u2014he was so deep.\\u201d I took this in still more than, probably, I showed. \\u201cYou weren\\u2019t afraid of anything else? Not of his effect\\u2014?\\u201d \\u201cHis effect?\\u201d she repeated with a face of anguish and waiting while I faltered. \\u201cOn innocent little precious lives. They were in your charge.\\u201d \\u201cNo, they were not in mine!\\u201d she roundly and distressfully returned. \\u201cThe master believed in\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"presently to pull herself together again, as if from the positive force of the sense of what, should we yield an inch, there would really be to give way to. \\u201cDear, dear\\u2014we must keep our heads! And after all, if she doesn\\u2019t mind it\\u2014!\\u201d She even tried a grim joke. \\u201cPerhaps she likes it!\\u201d \\u201cLikes such things\\u2014a scrap of an infant!\\u201d \\u201cIsn\\u2019t it just a proof of her blessed innocence?\\u201d my friend bravely inquired. She brought me, for the instant, almost round. \\u201cOh, we must clutch at that\\u2014we must cling to it! If it isn\\u2019t a proof of what you\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"her, and ended by showing me, on this ground, an awestricken tenderness, an expression of the sense of my more than questionable privilege, of which the very breath has remained with me as that of the sweetest of human charities. What was settled between us, accordingly, that night, was that we thought we might bear things together; and I was not even sure that, in spite of her exemption, it was she who had the best of the burden. I knew at this hour, I think, as well as I knew later, what I was capable of meeting to shelter\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"could put her little conscious hand straight upon the spot that ached. She had looked at me in sweet speculation and then had accused me to my face of having \\u201ccried.\\u201d I had supposed I had brushed away the ugly signs: but I could literally\\u2014for the time, at all events\\u2014rejoice, under this fathomless charity, that they had not entirely disappeared. To gaze into the depths of blue of the child\\u2019s eyes and pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which I naturally preferred to abjure my judgment and, so\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"came, just there, down to the brink and that had been an assistance to disembarking. I recognized, as I looked at the pair of short, thick oars, quite safely drawn up, the prodigious character of the feat for a little girl; but I had lived, by this time, too long among wonders and had panted to too many livelier measures. There was a gate in the fence, through which we passed, and that brought us, after a trifling interval, more into the open. Then, \\u201cThere she is!\\u201d we both exclaimed at once. Flora, a short way off, stood before us\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"me, I might have appeared to provide against some danger of rebellion. I was like a gaoler with an eye to possible surprises and escapes. But all this belonged\\u2014I mean their magnificent little surrender\\u2014just to the special array of the facts that were most abysmal. Turned out for Sunday by his uncle\\u2019s tailor, who had had a free hand and a notion of pretty waistcoats and of his grand little air, Miles\\u2019s whole title to independence, the rights of his sex and situation, were so stamped upon him that if he had suddenly struck for freedom I should have had\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"by exception, in that cold, clean temple of mahogany and brass, the \\u201cgrown-up\\u201d dining room. The gloves had been dropped there, and I turned in to recover them. The day was gray enough, but the afternoon light still lingered, and it enabled me, on crossing the threshold, not only to recognize, on a chair near the wide window, then closed, the articles I wanted, but to become aware of a person on the other side of the window and looking straight in. One step into the room had sufficed; my vision was instantaneous; it was all there. The person looking\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I stood over him with my candle. \\u201cHow did you know I was there?\\u201d \\u201cWhy, of course I heard you. Did you fancy you made no noise? You\\u2019re like a troop of cavalry!\\u201d he beautifully laughed. \\u201cThen you weren\\u2019t asleep?\\u201d \\u201cNot much! I lie awake and think.\\u201d I had put my candle, designedly, a short way off, and then, as he held out his friendly old hand to me, had sat down on the edge of his bed. \\u201cWhat is it,\\u201d I asked, \\u201cthat you think of?\\u201d \\u201cWhat in the world, my dear, but you?\\u201d \\u201cAh, the pride I take\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"\\u201cOh!\\u201d Mrs. Grose mumbled. This was a suggestion that it didn\\u2019t matter; which indeed she backed up by a further remark. \\u201cYou see, after all, Miss Jessel didn\\u2019t mind. She didn\\u2019t forbid him.\\u201d I considered. \\u201cDid he put that to you as a justification?\\u201d At this she dropped again. \\u201cNo, he never spoke of it.\\u201d \\u201cNever mentioned her in connection with Quint?\\u201d She saw, visibly flushing, where I was coming out. \\u201cWell, he didn\\u2019t show anything. He denied,\\u201d she repeated; \\u201che denied.\\u201d Lord, how I pressed her now! \\u201cSo that you could see he knew what was between the two\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"thing was virtually out between us. \\u201cAh, of course, she\\u2019s a jolly, \\u2018perfect\\u2019 lady; but, after all, I\\u2019m a fellow, don\\u2019t you see? that\\u2019s\\u2014well, getting on.\\u201d I lingered there with him an instant ever so kindly. \\u201cYes, you\\u2019re getting on.\\u201d Oh, but I felt helpless! I have kept to this day the heartbreaking little idea of how he seemed to know that and to play with it. \\u201cAnd you can\\u2019t say I\\u2019ve not been awfully good, can you?\\u201d I laid my hand on his shoulder, for, though I felt how much better it would have been to walk on, I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"dear!\\u201d She didn\\u2019t deny this, but I required, I felt, not even so much telling as that. She resumed in a moment, at any rate: \\u201cWhat if he should see him?\\u201d \\u201cLittle Miles? That\\u2019s what he wants!\\u201d She looked immensely scared again. \\u201cThe child?\\u201d \\u201cHeaven forbid! The man. He wants to appear to them.\\u201d That he might was an awful conception, and yet, somehow, I could keep it at bay; which, moreover, as we lingered there, was what I succeeded in practically proving. I had an absolute certainty that I should see again what I had already seen, but something\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I arranged with her, to her great satisfaction, that it should be she, she only, who might show me the place. She showed it step by step and room by room and secret by secret, with droll, delightful, childish talk about it and with the result, in half an hour, of our becoming immense friends. Young as she was, I was struck, throughout our little tour, with her confidence and courage with the way, in empty chambers and dull corridors, on crooked staircases that made me pause and even on the summit of an old machicolated square tower that made\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth. The departing ladies who had said they would stay didn\\u2019t, of course, thank heaven, stay: they departed, in consequence of arrangements made, in a rage of curiosity, as they professed, produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up. But that only made his little final auditory more compact and select, kept it, round the hearth, subject to a common thrill.\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the first night, of there being something undefinably astir in the house, and noted the soft breath of the open casement just move the half-drawn blind. Then, with all the marks of a deliberation that must have seemed magnificent had there been anyone to admire it, I laid down my book, rose to my feet, and, taking a candle, went straight out of the room and, from the passage, on which my light made little impression, noiselessly closed and locked the door. I can say now neither what determined nor what guided me, but I went straight along the lobby,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"if he had found even now\\u2014as he had so often found at lessons\\u2014still some other delicate way to ease me off. Wasn\\u2019t there light in the fact which, as we shared our solitude, broke out with a specious glitter it had never yet quite worn?\\u2014the fact that (opportunity aiding, precious opportunity which had now come) it would be preposterous, with a child so endowed, to forego the help one might wrest from absolute intelligence? What had his intelligence been given him for but to save him? Mightn\\u2019t one, to reach his mind, risk the stretch of an angular arm over\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"moment, but I had, thank God, no terror. And he knew I had not\\u2014I found myself at the end of an instant magnificently aware of this. I felt, in a fierce rigor of confidence, that if I stood my ground a minute I should cease\\u2014for the time, at least\\u2014to have him to reckon with; and during the minute, accordingly, the thing was as human and hideous as a real interview: hideous just because it was human, as human as to have met alone, in the small hours, in a sleeping house, some enemy, some adventurer, some criminal. It was the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"way it went, it reminds me of all the art I now need to make it a little distinct. What I look back at with amazement is the situation I accepted. I had undertaken, with my companion, to see it out, and I was under a charm, apparently, that could smooth away the extent and the far and difficult connections of such an effort. I was lifted aloft on a great wave of infatuation and pity. I found it simple, in my ignorance, my confusion, and perhaps my conceit, to assume that I could deal with a boy whose education\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I found myself, to meet my friend the better, offering it, on the spot, sarcastically. \\u201cTo his poor little innocent mates!\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s too dreadful,\\u201d cried Mrs. Grose, \\u201cto say such cruel things! Why, he\\u2019s scarce ten years old.\\u201d \\u201cYes, yes; it would be incredible.\\u201d She was evidently grateful for such a profession. \\u201cSee him, miss, first. Then believe it!\\u201d I felt forthwith a new impatience to see him; it was the beginning of a curiosity that, for all the next hours, was to deepen almost to pain. Mrs. Grose was aware, I could judge, of what she had produced in\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"skirts the dreadful little face. In this position she produced an almost furious wail. \\u201cTake me away, take me away\\u2014oh, take me away from her!\\u201d \\u201cFrom me?\\u201d I panted. \\u201cFrom you\\u2014from you!\\u201d she cried. Even Mrs. Grose looked across at me dismayed, while I had nothing to do but communicate again with the figure that, on the opposite bank, without a movement, as rigidly still as if catching, beyond the interval, our voices, was as vividly there for my disaster as it was not there for my service. The wretched child had spoken exactly as if she had got from\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"aware afresh, with her, as we went, of how, like her brother, she contrived\\u2014it was the charming thing in both children\\u2014to let me alone without appearing to drop me and to accompany me without appearing to surround. They were never importunate and yet never listless. My attention to them all really went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely without me: this was a spectacle they seemed actively to prepare and that engaged me as an active admirer. I walked in a world of their invention\\u2014they had no occasion whatever to draw upon mine; so that my time was taken only\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"This thought held me sufficiently to make me cross to his threshold and pause again. I preternaturally listened; I figured to myself what might portentously be; I wondered if his bed were also empty and he too were secretly at watch. It was a deep, soundless minute, at the end of which my impulse failed. He was quiet; he might be innocent; the risk was hideous; I turned away. There was a figure in the grounds\\u2014a figure prowling for a sight, the visitor with whom Flora was engaged; but it was not the visitor most concerned with my boy. I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"of a messenger, a postman, or a tradesman\\u2019s boy, from the village. That reminder had as little effect on my practical certitude as I was conscious\\u2014still even without looking\\u2014of its having upon the character and attitude of our visitor. Nothing was more natural than that these things should be the other things that they absolutely were not. Of the positive identity of the apparition I would assure myself as soon as the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the right second; meanwhile, with an effort that was already sharp enough, I transferred my eyes straight to little\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"that I could deal with a boy whose education for the world was all on the point of beginning. I am unable even to remember at this day what proposal I framed for the end of his holidays and the resumption of his studies. Lessons with me, indeed, that charming summer, we all had a theory that he was to have; but I now feel that, for weeks, the lessons must have been rather my own. I learned something\\u2014at first, certainly\\u2014that had not been one of the teachings of my small, smothered life; learned to be amused, and even amusing,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"She was struck with our bareheaded aspect. \\u201cWhy, where are your things?\\u201d \\u201cWhere yours are, my dear!\\u201d I promptly returned. She had already got back her gaiety, and appeared to take this as an answer quite sufficient. \\u201cAnd where\\u2019s Miles?\\u201d she went on. There was something in the small valor of it that quite finished me: these three words from her were, in a flash like the glitter of a drawn blade, the jostle of the cup that my hand, for weeks and weeks, had held high and full to the brim that now, even before speaking, I felt overflow\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"kind of brush of the sponge. I have spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish grace as a thing I could actively cultivate, and it may be imagined if I neglected now to address myself to this source for whatever it would yield. Stranger than I can express, certainly, was the effort to struggle against my new lights; it would doubtless have been, however, a greater tension still had it not been so frequently successful. I used to wonder how my little charges could help guessing that I thought strange things about them; and the circumstances that these things\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"and even on the summit of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy, her morning music, her disposition to tell me so many more things than she asked, rang out and led me on. I have not seen Bly since the day I left it, and I daresay that to my older and more informed eyes it would now appear sufficiently contracted. But as my little conductress, with her hair of gold and her frock of blue, danced before me round corners and pattered down passages, I had the view of a castle of romance inhabited by a\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"of which\\u2014like the flash of a fish in a stream\\u2014the mockery of their advantage peeped up. The shock, in truth, had sunk into me still deeper than I knew on the night when, looking out to see either Quint or Miss Jessel under the stars, I had beheld the boy over whose rest I watched and who had immediately brought in with him\\u2014had straightway, there, turned it on me\\u2014the lovely upward look with which, from the battlements above me, the hideous apparition of Quint had played. If it was a question of a scare, my discovery on this occasion had\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"go. I threw myself upon him and in the tenderness of my pity I embraced him. \\u201cDear little Miles, dear little Miles\\u2014!\\u201d My face was close to his, and he let me kiss him, simply taking it with indulgent good humor. \\u201cWell, old lady?\\u201d \\u201cIs there nothing\\u2014nothing at all that you want to tell me?\\u201d He turned off a little, facing round toward the wall and holding up his hand to look at as one had seen sick children look. \\u201cI\\u2019ve told you\\u2014I told you this morning.\\u201d Oh, I was sorry for him! \\u201cThat you just want me not to\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"wonder that in a few instants more became intense. The great question, or one of these, is, afterward, I know, with regard to certain matters, the question of how long they have lasted. Well, this matter of mine, think what you will of it, lasted while I caught at a dozen possibilities, none of which made a difference for the better, that I could see, in there having been in the house\\u2014and for how long, above all?\\u2014a person of whom I was in ignorance. It lasted while I just bridled a little with the sense that my office demanded that\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"toward the close of the June afternoon, a commodious fly in waiting for me. Driving at that hour, on a lovely day, through a country to which the summer sweetness seemed to offer me a friendly welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the avenue, encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to which it had sunk. I suppose I had expected, or had dreaded, something so melancholy that what greeted me was a good surprise. I remember as a most pleasant impression the broad, clear front, its open windows and fresh\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"incitement. If it was easy to reflect, however, that such a boy could postpone school, it was at least as marked that for such a boy to have been \\u201ckicked out\\u201d by a schoolmaster was a mystification without end. Let me add that in their company now\\u2014and I was careful almost never to be out of it\\u2014I could follow no scent very far. We lived in a cloud of music and love and success and private theatricals. The musical sense in each of the children was of the quickest, but the elder in especial had a marvelous knack of catching\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"and went home?\\u201d \\u201cShe was not taken ill, so far as appeared, in this house. She left it, at the end of the year, to go home, as she said, for a short holiday, to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right. We had then a young woman\\u2014a nursemaid who had stayed on and who was a good girl and clever; and she took the children altogether for the interval. But our young lady never came back, and at the very moment I was expecting her I heard from the master that she was\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"only asked that he should know; and the only way to be sure he knew would be to see it, and the kind light of it, in his handsome face. That was exactly present to me\\u2014by which I mean the face was\\u2014when, on the first of these occasions, at the end of a long June day, I stopped short on emerging from one of the plantations and coming into view of the house. What arrested me on the spot\\u2014and with a shock much greater than any vision had allowed for\\u2014was the sense that my imagination had, in a flash, turned\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"passed that night, by the most tacit, and I should add, were not the word so grotesque a false note, the happiest of arrangements, with Mrs. Grose. I saw neither of them on my return, but, on the other hand, as by an ambiguous compensation, I saw a great deal of Miles. I saw\\u2014I can use no other phrase\\u2014so much of him that it was as if it were more than it had ever been. No evening I had passed at Bly had the portentous quality of this one; in spite of which\\u2014and in spite also of the deeper depths\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"felt overflow in a deluge. \\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you if you\\u2019ll tell me\\u2014\\u201d I heard myself say, then heard the tremor in which it broke. \\u201cWell, what?\\u201d Mrs. Grose\\u2019s suspense blazed at me, but it was too late now, and I brought the thing out handsomely. \\u201cWhere, my pet, is Miss Jessel?\\u201d Just as in the churchyard with Miles, the whole thing was upon us. Much as I had made of the fact that this name had never once, between us, been sounded, the quick, smitten glare with which the child\\u2019s face now received it fairly likened my breach of the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"can hear again, as I write, the intense hush in which the sounds of evening dropped. The rooks stopped cawing in the golden sky, and the friendly hour lost, for the minute, all its voice. But there was no other change in nature, unless indeed it were a change that I saw with a stranger sharpness. The gold was still in the sky, the clearness in the air, and the man who looked at me over the battlements was as definite as a picture in a frame. That\\u2019s how I thought, with extraordinary quickness, of each person that he might\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"own servants to wait on them and going down himself, whenever he might, to see how they were doing. The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time. He had put them in possession of Bly, which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of their little establishment\\u2014but below stairs only\\u2014an excellent woman, Mrs. Grose, whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly been maid to his mother. She was now housekeeper and was also acting for the time as superintendent\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"had come into view like a sentinel before a prison. The next thing I saw was that, from outside, he had reached the window, and then I knew that, close to the glass and glaring in through it, he offered once more to the room his white face of damnation. It represents but grossly what took place within me at the sight to say that on the second my decision was made; yet I believe that no woman so overwhelmed ever in so short a time recovered her grasp of the act. It came to me in the very horror\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I should have taken at the first blush for some housemaid who might have stayed at home to look after the place and who, availing herself of rare relief from observation and of the schoolroom table and my pens, ink, and paper, had applied herself to the considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart. There was an effort in the way that, while her arms rested on the table, her hands with evident weariness supported her head; but at the moment I took this in I had already become aware that, in spite of my entrance, her attitude strangely\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"you had been with either child, you would clearly have understood. The more I\\u2019ve watched and waited the more I\\u2019ve felt that if there were nothing else to make it sure it would be made so by the systematic silence of each. Never, by a slip of the tongue, have they so much as alluded to either of their old friends, any more than Miles has alluded to his expulsion. Oh, yes, we may sit here and look at them, and they may show off to us there to their fill; but even while they pretend to be lost in\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"went, and Quint was alone.\\u201d I followed, but halting a little. \\u201cAlone?\\u201d \\u201cAlone with us.\\u201d Then, as from a deeper depth, \\u201cIn charge,\\u201d she added. \\u201cAnd what became of him?\\u201d She hung fire so long that I was still more mystified. \\u201cHe went, too,\\u201d she brought out at last. \\u201cWent where?\\u201d Her expression, at this, became extraordinary. \\u201cGod knows where! He died.\\u201d \\u201cDied?\\u201d I almost shrieked. She seemed fairly to square herself, plant herself more firmly to utter the wonder of it. \\u201cYes. Mr. Quint is dead.\\u201d It took of course more than that particular passage to place us together\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"looked at me in sweet speculation and then had accused me to my face of having \\u201ccried.\\u201d I had supposed I had brushed away the ugly signs: but I could literally\\u2014for the time, at all events\\u2014rejoice, under this fathomless charity, that they had not entirely disappeared. To gaze into the depths of blue of the child\\u2019s eyes and pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which I naturally preferred to abjure my judgment and, so far as might be, my agitation. I couldn\\u2019t abjure for merely wanting to, but\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the face of what, in our prodigious experience, was least to be questioned. Late that night, while the house slept, we had another talk in my room, when she went all the way with me as to its being beyond doubt that I had seen exactly what I had seen. To hold her perfectly in the pinch of that, I found I had only to ask her how, if I had \\u201cmade it up,\\u201d I came to be able to give, of each of the persons appearing to me, a picture disclosing, to the last detail, their special marks\\u2014a portrait\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"great betrayal. I saw him, from the midst of my act, meet it with a divination, and on the perception that even now he only guessed, and that the window was still to his own eyes free, I let the impulse flame up to convert the climax of his dismay into the very proof of his liberation. \\u201cNo more, no more, no more!\\u201d I shrieked, as I tried to press him against me, to my visitant. \\u201cIs she here?\\u201d Miles panted as he caught with his sealed eyes the direction of my words. Then as his strange \\u201cshe\\u201d staggered me\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"might have failed. It was an immense help to me\\u2014I confess I rather applaud myself as I look back!\\u2014that I saw my service so strongly and so simply. I was there to protect and defend the little creatures in the world the most bereaved and the most lovable, the appeal of whose helplessness had suddenly become only too explicit, a deep, constant ache of one\\u2019s own committed heart. We were cut off, really, together; we were united in our danger. They had nothing but me, and I\\u2014well, I had them. It was in short a magnificent chance. This chance presented\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"long enough to catch it, the feeling of the medium in which, that June evening out of doors, I had had my first sight of Quint, and in which, too, at those other instants, I had, after seeing him through the window, looked for him in vain in the circle of shrubbery. I recognized the signs, the portents\\u2014I recognized the moment, the spot. But they remained unaccompanied and empty, and I continued unmolested; if unmolested one could call a young woman whose sensibility had, in the most extraordinary fashion, not declined but deepened. I had said in my talk with\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"perceived, at least, that it would give me a measure. No hour of my stay in fact was so assailed with apprehensions as that of my coming down to learn that the carriage containing Mrs. Grose and my younger pupil had already rolled out of the gates. Now I was, I said to myself, face to face with the elements, and for much of the rest of the day, while I fought my weakness, I could consider that I had been supremely rash. It was a tighter place still than I had yet turned round in; all the more that,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"companion bravely concurred. \\u201cNever again to so much as look at you.\\u201d \\u201cSo that what you\\u2019ve come to me now for,\\u201d I asked, \\u201cis to speed me on my way?\\u201d Before she had time to reply, however, I had her in check. \\u201cI\\u2019ve a better idea\\u2014the result of my reflections. My going would seem the right thing, and on Sunday I was terribly near it. Yet that won\\u2019t do. It\\u2019s you who must go. You must take Flora.\\u201d My visitor, at this, did speculate. \\u201cBut where in the world\\u2014?\\u201d \\u201cAway from here. Away from them. Away, even most of all,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"and I will tell you\\u2014I will. But not now.\\u201d \\u201cWhy not now?\\u201d My insistence turned him from me and kept him once more at his window in a silence during which, between us, you might have heard a pin drop. Then he was before me again with the air of a person for whom, outside, someone who had frankly to be reckoned with was waiting. \\u201cI have to see Luke.\\u201d I had not yet reduced him to quite so vulgar a lie, and I felt proportionately ashamed. But, horrible as it was, his lies made up my truth. I achieved\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"kind of image, for him, of a kind of failure. I felt that I saw him, at any rate, shut in or shut out. He was admirable, but not comfortable: I took it in with a throb of hope. Wasn\\u2019t he looking, through the haunted pane, for something he couldn\\u2019t see?\\u2014and wasn\\u2019t it the first time in the whole business that he had known such a lapse? The first, the very first: I found it a splendid portent. It made him anxious, though he watched himself; he had been anxious all day and, even while in his usual sweet little\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"was no one to stop me; I could give the whole thing up\\u2014turn my back and retreat. It was only a question of hurrying again, for a few preparations, to the house which the attendance at church of so many of the servants would practically have left unoccupied. No one, in short, could blame me if I should just drive desperately off. What was it to get away if I got away only till dinner? That would be in a couple of hours, at the end of which\\u2014I had the acute prevision\\u2014my little pupils would play at innocent wonder about\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"three times over, as if with difficulty. He might have been standing at the bottom of the sea and raising his eyes to some faint green twilight. \\u201cWell\\u2014I said things.\\u201d \\u201cOnly that?\\u201d \\u201cThey thought it was enough!\\u201d \\u201cTo turn you out for?\\u201d Never, truly, had a person \\u201cturned out\\u201d shown so little to explain it as this little person! He appeared to weigh my question, but in a manner quite detached and almost helpless. \\u201cWell, I suppose I oughtn\\u2019t.\\u201d \\u201cBut to whom did you say them?\\u201d He evidently tried to remember, but it dropped\\u2014he had lost it. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know!\\u201d\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"strangest look. \\u201cEverything?\\u201d \\u201cEverything. Therefore did you\\u2014?\\u201d But I couldn\\u2019t say it again. Miles could, very simply. \\u201cNo. I didn\\u2019t steal.\\u201d My face must have shown him I believed him utterly; yet my hands\\u2014but it was for pure tenderness\\u2014shook him as if to ask him why, if it was all for nothing, he had condemned me to months of torment. \\u201cWhat then did you do?\\u201d He looked in vague pain all round the top of the room and drew his breath, two or three times over, as if with difficulty. He might have been standing at the bottom of the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"replied; after which she added: \\u201cWhat is he like?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ve been dying to tell you. But he\\u2019s like nobody.\\u201d \\u201cNobody?\\u201d she echoed. \\u201cHe has no hat.\\u201d Then seeing in her face that she already, in this, with a deeper dismay, found a touch of picture, I quickly added stroke to stroke. \\u201cHe has red hair, very red, close-curling, and a pale face, long in shape, with straight, good features and little, rather queer whiskers that are as red as his hair. His eyebrows are, somehow, darker; they look particularly arched and as if they might move a good deal. His\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"eyes, then brought out the rest. \\u201cYour idea\\u2019s the right one. I myself, miss\\u2014\\u201d \\u201cWell?\\u201d \\u201cI can\\u2019t stay.\\u201d The look she gave me with it made me jump at possibilities. \\u201cYou mean that, since yesterday, you have seen\\u2014?\\u201d She shook her head with dignity. \\u201cI\\u2019ve heard\\u2014!\\u201d \\u201cHeard?\\u201d \\u201cFrom that child\\u2014horrors! There!\\u201d she sighed with tragic relief. \\u201cOn my honor, miss, she says things\\u2014!\\u201d But at this evocation she broke down; she dropped, with a sudden sob, upon my sofa and, as I had seen her do before, gave way to all the grief of it. It was quite in another\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"\\u201cHas she said to you since yesterday\\u2014except to repudiate her familiarity with anything so dreadful\\u2014a single other word about Miss Jessel?\\u201d \\u201cNot one, miss. And of course you know,\\u201d my friend added, \\u201cI took it from her, by the lake, that, just then and there at least, there was nobody.\\u201d \\u201cRather! and, naturally, you take it from her still.\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t contradict her. What else can I do?\\u201d \\u201cNothing in the world! You\\u2019ve the cleverest little person to deal with.

Mrs. Grose watched them with positive placidity; then I caught the suppressed intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to take from me a view of the back of the tapestry. I had made her a receptacle of lurid things, but there was an odd recognition of my superiority\\u2014my accomplishments and my function\\u2014in her patience under my pain. She offered her mind to my disclosures as, had I wished to mix a witch\\u2019s broth and proposed it with assurance, she would have held out a large\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"children again. \\u201cYes, he do hate worry. That was the great reason\\u2014\\u201d \\u201cWhy those fiends took him in so long? No doubt, though his indifference must have been awful. As I\\u2019m not a fiend, at any rate, I shouldn\\u2019t take him in.\\u201d My companion, after an instant and for all answer, sat down again and grasped my arm. \\u201cMake him at any rate come to you.\\u201d I stared. \\u201cTo me?\\u201d I had a sudden fear of what she might do. \\u201c\\u2018Him\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cHe ought to be here\\u2014he ought to help.\\u201d I quickly rose, and I think I must have shown her\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"later on, so much more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill. The most singular part of it, in fact\\u2014singular as the rest had been\\u2014was the part I became, in the hall, aware of in meeting Mrs. Grose. This picture comes back to me in the general train\\u2014the impression, as I received it on my return, of the wide white panelled space, bright in the lamplight and with its portraits and red carpet, and of the good surprised look of my friend, which immediately told me she had missed me. It came to me straightway,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"only want to show him that it was better still than that. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not Miss Jessel! But it\\u2019s at the window\\u2014straight before us. It\\u2019s there\\u2014the coward horror, there for the last time!\\u201d At this, after a second in which his head made the movement of a baffled dog\\u2019s on a scent and then gave a frantic little shake for air and light, he was at me in a white rage, bewildered, glaring vainly over the place and missing wholly, though it now, to my sense, filled the room like the taste of poison, the wide, overwhelming presence. \\u201cIt\\u2019s he?\\u201d I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"when, on his joining me in the schoolroom the previous night, I had uttered, on the subject of the interval just concluded, neither challenge nor hint. I had too much, from this moment, my other ideas. Yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of applying them, the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home to me by the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as yet, for the eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow. To mark, for the house, the high state I cultivated I decreed that my meals with the boy should be served,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"again: \\u201cI can\\u2019t begin. I shall have to send to town.\\u201d There was a unanimous groan at this, and much reproach; after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained. \\u201cThe story\\u2019s written. It\\u2019s in a locked drawer\\u2014it has not been out for years. I could write to my man and enclose the key; he could send down the packet as he finds it.\\u201d It was to me in particular that he appeared to propound this\\u2014appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate. He had broken a thickness of ice, the formation of many a winter; had had his reasons\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"so I showed them off as I might. \\u201cI hope then it was to more purpose than in this case! The note, at any rate, that I put on the table yesterday,\\u201d I pursued, \\u201cwill have given him so scant an advantage\\u2014for it contained only the bare demand for an interview\\u2014that he is already much ashamed of having gone so far for so little, and that what he had on his mind last evening was precisely the need of confession.\\u201d I seemed to myself, for the instant, to have mastered it, to see it all. \\u201cLeave us, leave us\\u201d\\u2014I was\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"was it to see his little brain puzzled and his little resources taxed to play, under the spell laid on him, a part of innocence and consistency. \\u201cNo, never\\u2014from the hour you came back. You\\u2019ve never mentioned to me one of your masters, one of your comrades, nor the least little thing that ever happened to you at school. Never, little Miles\\u2014no, never\\u2014have you given me an inkling of anything that may have happened there. Therefore you can fancy how much I\\u2019m in the dark. Until you came out, that way, this morning, you had, since the first hour I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"we had done to Flora, but this made me only want to show him that it was better still than that. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not Miss Jessel!

It\\u2019s there\\u2014the coward horror, there for the last time!\\u201d At this, after a second in which his head made the movement of a baffled dog\\u2019s on a scent and then gave a frantic little shake for air and light, he was at me in a white rage, bewildered, glaring vainly over the place and missing wholly, though it now, to my sense, filled the room like the taste\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"this figure, in the clear twilight, I remember, two distinct gasps of emotion, which were, sharply, the shock of my first and that of my second surprise. My second was a violent perception of the mistake of my first: the man who met my eyes was not the person I had precipitately supposed. There came to me thus a bewilderment of vision of which, after these years, there is no living view that I can hope to give. An unknown man in a lonely place is a permitted object of fear to a young woman privately bred; and the figure\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"that what had perhaps sprung highest was the absurdity of our prolonging the fiction that I had anything more to teach him. It sufficiently stuck out that, by tacit little tricks in which even more than myself he carried out the care for my dignity, I had had to appeal to him to let me off straining to meet him on the ground of his true capacity. He had at any rate his freedom now; I was never to touch it again; as I had amply shown, moreover, when, on his joining me in the schoolroom the previous night, I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"off.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know what there was in this brevity of Mrs. Grose\\u2019s that struck me as ambiguous. \\u201cWent off to die?\\u201d Mrs. Grose looked straight out of the window, but I felt that, hypothetically, I had a right to know what young persons engaged for Bly were expected to do. \\u201cShe was taken ill, you mean, and went home?\\u201d \\u201cShe was not taken ill, so far as appeared, in this house. She left it, at the end of the year, to go home, as she said, for a short holiday, to which the time she had put in had\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"what I was doing. To do it in any way was an act of violence, for what did it consist of but the obtrusion of the idea of grossness and guilt on a small helpless creature who had been for me a revelation of the possibilities of beautiful intercourse? Wasn\\u2019t it base to create for a being so exquisite a mere alien awkwardness? I suppose I now read into our situation a clearness it couldn\\u2019t have had at the time, for I seem to see our poor eyes already lighted with some spark of a prevision of the anguish that\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"in a glow of high fashion, of good looks, of expensive habits, of charming ways with women. He had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase; but it was to his country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished her immediately to proceed. He had been left, by the death of their parents in India, guardian to a small nephew and a small niece, children of a younger, a military brother, whom he had lost two years before. These children were, by the strangest\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"nothing in the world but love. It would have been impossible to carry a bad name with a greater sweetness of innocence, and by the time I had got back to Bly with him I remained merely bewildered\\u2014so far, that is, as I was not outraged\\u2014by the sense of the horrible letter locked up in my room, in a drawer. As soon as I could compass a private word with Mrs. Grose I declared to her that it was grotesque. She promptly understood me. \\u201cYou mean the cruel charge\\u2014?\\u201d \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t live an instant. My dear woman, look at him!\\u201d\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"coach that carried me to the stopping place at which I was to be met by a vehicle from the house. This convenience, I was told, had been ordered, and I found, toward the close of the June afternoon, a commodious fly in waiting for me. Driving at that hour, on a lovely day, through a country to which the summer sweetness seemed to offer me a friendly welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh and, as we turned into the avenue, encountered a reprieve that was probably but a proof of the point to which it had sunk. I suppose I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I had simply gone straight to my room to change what I was wearing and to take in, at a glance, much material testimony to Flora\\u2019s rupture. Her little belongings had all been removed. When later, by the schoolroom fire, I was served with tea by the usual maid, I indulged, on the article of my other pupil, in no inquiry whatever. He had his freedom now\\u2014he might have it to the end! Well, he did have it; and it consisted\\u2014in part at least\\u2014of his coming in at about eight o\\u2019clock and sitting down with me in silence. On the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"false note, the happiest of arrangements, with Mrs. Grose. I saw neither of them on my return, but, on the other hand, as by an ambiguous compensation, I saw a great deal of Miles. I saw\\u2014I can use no other phrase\\u2014so much of him that it was as if it were more than it had ever been. No evening I had passed at Bly had the portentous quality of this one; in spite of which\\u2014and in spite also of the deeper depths of consternation that had opened beneath my feet\\u2014there was literally, in the ebbing actual, an extraordinarily sweet sadness.\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the place and looked, I have no doubt, as if I were ready for any onset. So, for the benefit of whom it might concern, I paraded with a sick heart. The person it appeared least to concern proved to be, till dinner, little Miles himself. My perambulations had given me, meanwhile, no glimpse of him, but they had tended to make more public the change taking place in our relation as a consequence of his having at the piano, the day before, kept me, in Flora\\u2019s interest, so beguiled and befooled. The stamp of publicity had of course been\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"and they were again, with Mrs. Grose on her feet, united, as it were, in pained opposition to me. Flora continued to fix me with her small mask of reprobation, and even at that minute I prayed God to forgive me for seeming to see that, as she stood there holding tight to our friend\\u2019s dress, her incomparable childish beauty had suddenly failed, had quite vanished. I\\u2019ve said it already\\u2014she was literally, she was hideously, hard; she had turned common and almost ugly. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what you mean. I see nobody. I see nothing. I never have. I think\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"to show you I could!\\u201d \\u201cOh, yes, you could.\\u201d \\u201cAnd I can again.\\u201d I felt that I might, perhaps, after all, succeed in keeping my wits about me. \\u201cCertainly. But you won\\u2019t.\\u201d \\u201cNo, not that again. It was nothing.\\u201d \\u201cIt was nothing,\\u201d I said. \\u201cBut we must go on.\\u201d He resumed our walk with me, passing his hand into my arm. \\u201cThen when am I going back?\\u201d I wore, in turning it over, my most responsible air. \\u201cWere you very happy at school?\\u201d He just considered. \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m happy enough anywhere!\\u201d \\u201cWell, then,\\u201d I quavered, \\u201cif you\\u2019re just as happy\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"he were innocent, what then on earth was I? Paralyzed, while it lasted, by the mere brush of the question, I let him go a little, so that, with a deep-drawn sigh, he turned away from me again; which, as he faced toward the clear window, I suffered, feeling that I had nothing now there to keep him from. \\u201cAnd did they repeat what you said?\\u201d I went on after a moment. He was soon at some distance from me, still breathing hard and again with the air, though now without anger for it, of being confined against his will.\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"that, however, he continued as if with the sense that this was an impertinence to be softened. \\u201cNothing could be more charming than the way you take it, for of course if we\\u2019re alone together now it\\u2019s you that are alone most. But I hope,\\u201d he threw in, \\u201cyou don\\u2019t particularly mind!\\u201d \\u201cHaving to do with you?\\u201d I asked. \\u201cMy dear child, how can I help minding? Though I\\u2019ve renounced all claim to your company\\u2014you\\u2019re so beyond me\\u2014I at least greatly enjoy it. What else should I stay on for?\\u201d He looked at me more directly, and the expression of\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"listened to the lash of the rain and the batter of the gusts. Finally I went out, taking a candle; I crossed the passage and listened a minute at Miles\\u2019s door. What, under my endless obsession, I had been impelled to listen for was some betrayal of his not being at rest, and I presently caught one, but not in the form I had expected. His voice tinkled out. \\u201cI say, you there\\u2014come in.\\u201d It was a gaiety in the gloom! I went in with my light and found him, in bed, very wide awake, but very much at his\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"a crisp, clear day, the first of its order for some time; the night had brought a touch of frost, and the autumn air, bright and sharp, made the church bells almost gay. It was an odd accident of thought that I should have happened at such a moment to be particularly and very gratefully struck with the obedience of my little charges. Why did they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual society? Something or other had brought nearer home to me that I had all but pinned the boy to my shawl and that, in the way our companions\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"but their beauty and amiability, their happiness and cleverness, she had no direct communication with the sources of my trouble. If they had been at all visibly blighted or battered, she would doubtless have grown, on tracing it back, haggard enough to match them; as matters stood, however, I could feel her, when she surveyed them, with her large white arms folded and the habit of serenity in all her look, thank the Lord\\u2019s mercy that if they were ruined the pieces would still serve. Flights of fancy gave place, in her mind, to a steady fireside glow, and I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"the very things that have delighted, fascinated, and yet, at bottom, as I now so strangely see, mystified and troubled me. Their more than earthly beauty, their absolutely unnatural goodness. It\\u2019s a game,\\u201d I went on; \\u201cit\\u2019s a policy and a fraud!\\u201d \\u201cOn the part of little darlings\\u2014?\\u201d \\u201cAs yet mere lovely babies? Yes, mad as that seems!\\u201d The very act of bringing it out really helped me to trace it\\u2014follow it all up and piece it all together. \\u201cThey haven\\u2019t been good\\u2014they\\u2019ve only been absent. It has been easy to live with them, because they\\u2019re simply leading a life\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"and saw it move and shift its posture. I have likened it to a sentinel, but its slow wheel, for a moment, was rather the prowl of a baffled beast. My present quickened courage, however, was such that, not too much to let it through, I had to shade, as it were, my flame. Meanwhile the glare of the face was again at the window, the scoundrel fixed as if to watch and wait. It was the very confidence that I might now defy him, as well as the positive certitude, by this time, of the child\\u2019s unconsciousness, that made\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"to the spectacle, he slowly changed his place\\u2014passed, looking at me hard all the while, to the opposite corner of the platform. Yes, I had the sharpest sense that during this transit he never took his eyes from me, and I can see at this moment the way his hand, as he went, passed from one of the crenelations to the next. He stopped at the other corner, but less long, and even as he turned away still markedly fixed me. He turned away; that was all I knew. It was not that I didn\\u2019t wait, on this occasion, for\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"The first day had been, on the whole, as I have expressed, reassuring; but I was to see it wind up in keen apprehension. The postbag, that evening\\u2014it came late\\u2014contained a letter for me, which, however, in the hand of my employer, I found to be composed but of a few words enclosing another, addressed to himself, with a seal still unbroken. \\u201cThis, I recognize, is from the headmaster, and the headmaster\\u2019s an awful bore. Read him, please; deal with him; but mind you don\\u2019t report. Not a word. I\\u2019m off!\\u201d I broke the seal with a great effort\\u2014so great\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"fact that she was disturbed neither by my reillumination nor by the haste I made to get into slippers and into a wrap. Hidden, protected, absorbed, she evidently rested on the sill\\u2014the casement opened forward\\u2014and gave herself up. There was a great still moon to help her, and this fact had counted in my quick decision. She was face to face with the apparition we had met at the lake, and could now communicate with it as she had not then been able to do. What I, on my side, had to care for was, without disturbing her, to reach,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"though the dining room was on the ground floor, not going down to the terrace on which he stood. His face was close to the glass, yet the effect of this better view was, strangely, only to show me how intense the former had been. He remained but a few seconds\\u2014long enough to convince me he also saw and recognized; but it was as if I had been looking at him for years and had known him always. Something, however, happened this time that had not happened before; his stare into my face, through the glass and across the room,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"blunders, but he immensely pitied the poor chicks and had done all he could; had in particular sent them down to his other house, the proper place for them being of course the country, and kept them there, from the first, with the best people he could find to look after them, parting even with his own servants to wait on them and going down himself, whenever he might, to see how they were doing. The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time. He had put them\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"stone dead on the road from the village: a catastrophe explained\\u2014superficially at least\\u2014by a visible wound to his head; such a wound as might have been produced\\u2014and as, on the final evidence, had been\\u2014by a fatal slip, in the dark and after leaving the public house, on the steepish icy slope, a wrong path altogether, at the bottom of which he lay. The icy slope, the turn mistaken at night and in liquor, accounted for much\\u2014practically, in the end and after the inquest and boundless chatter, for everything; but there had been matters in his life\\u2014strange passages and perils, secret\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"of the idea that he must know how he really, as they say, \\u201chad\\u201d me. He could do what he liked, with all his cleverness to help him, so long as I should continue to defer to the old tradition of the criminality of those caretakers of the young who minister to superstitions and fears. He \\u201chad\\u201d me indeed, and in a cleft stick; for who would ever absolve me, who would consent that I should go unhung, if, by the faintest tremor of an overture, I were the first to introduce into our perfect intercourse an element so dire?\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I flashed into ice to challenge him. \\u201cWhom do you mean by \\u2018he\\u2019?\\u201d \\u201cPeter Quint\\u2014you devil!\\u201d His face gave again, round the room, its convulsed supplication. \\u201cWhere?\\u201d They are in my ears still, his supreme surrender of the name and his tribute to my devotion. \\u201cWhat does he matter now, my own?\\u2014what will he ever matter? I have you,\\u201d I launched at the beast, \\u201cbut he has lost you forever!\\u201d Then, for the demonstration of my work, \\u201cThere, there!\\u201d I said to Miles. But he had already jerked straight round, stared, glared again, and seen but the quiet day. With\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I felt, only too well; by which I mean that it suited exactly the particularly deadly view I was in the very act of forbidding myself to entertain. But I so far succeeded in checking the expression of this view that I will throw, just here, no further light on it than may be offered by the mention of my final observation to Mrs. Grose. \\u201cHis having lied and been impudent are, I confess, less engaging specimens than I had hoped to have from you of the outbreak in him of the little natural man. Still,\\u201d I mused, \\u201cThey must\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"have lasted as they actually appeared to me to last. The terrace and the whole place, the lawn and the garden beyond it, all I could see of the park, were empty with a great emptiness. There were shrubberies and big trees, but I remember the clear assurance I felt that none of them concealed him. He was there or was not there: not there if I didn\\u2019t see him. I got hold of this; then, instinctively, instead of returning as I had come, went to the window. It was confusedly present to me that I ought to place myself\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"on which my light made little impression, noiselessly closed and locked the door. I can say now neither what determined nor what guided me, but I went straight along the lobby, holding my candle high, till I came within sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn of the staircase. At this point I precipitately found myself aware of three things. They were practically simultaneous, yet they had flashes of succession. My candle, under a bold flourish, went out, and I perceived, by the uncovered window, that the yielding dusk of earliest morning rendered it unnecessary. Without\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"had no opportunity to ask him! This evening, you see,\\u201d I pursued, \\u201che has not been able to get in.\\u201d \\u201cHe only peeps?\\u201d \\u201cI hope it will be confined to that!\\u201d She had now let go my hand; she turned away a little. I waited an instant; then I brought out: \\u201cGo to church. Goodbye. I must watch.\\u201d Slowly she faced me again. \\u201cDo you fear for them?\\u201d We met in another long look. \\u201cDon\\u2019t you?\\u201d Instead of answering she came nearer to the window and, for a minute, applied her face to the glass. \\u201cYou see how he could\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"morning. It was exactly as if they had both had at heart to gloss over any recent little friction. They performed the dizziest feats of arithmetic, soaring quite out of my feeble range, and perpetrated, in higher spirits than ever, geographical and historical jokes. It was conspicuous of course in Miles in particular that he appeared to wish to show how easily he could let me down. This child, to my memory, really lives in a setting of beauty and misery that no words can translate; there was a distinction all his own in every impulse he revealed; never was\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"any other, and it was in the condition of nerves produced by it that I made my actual inductions. They harassed me so that sometimes, at odd moments, I shut myself up audibly to rehearse\\u2014it was at once a fantastic relief and a renewed despair\\u2014the manner in which I might come to the point. I approached it from one side and the other while, in my room, I flung myself about, but I always broke down in the monstrous utterance of names. As they died away on my lips, I said to myself that I should indeed help them to\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"had come there. He had come for someone else. The flash of this knowledge\\u2014for it was knowledge in the midst of dread\\u2014produced in me the most extraordinary effect, started as I stood there, a sudden vibration of duty and courage. I say courage because I was beyond all doubt already far gone. I bounded straight out of the door again, reached that of the house, got, in an instant, upon the drive, and, passing along the terrace as fast as I could rush, turned a corner and came full in sight. But it was in sight of nothing now\\u2014my visitor\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"it occurred to me that I might occasionally excite suspicion by the little outbreaks of my sharper passion for them, so too I remember wondering if I mightn\\u2019t see a queerness in the traceable increase of their own demonstrations. They were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me; which, after all, I could reflect, was no more than a graceful response in children perpetually bowed over and hugged. The homage of which they were so lavish succeeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if I never appeared to myself, as I may say, literally to\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"idea, take all color out of storybooks and fairytales. Wasn\\u2019t it just a storybook over which I had fallen adoze and adream? No; it was a big, ugly, antique, but convenient house, embodying a few features of a building still older, half-replaced and half-utilized, in which I had the fancy of our being almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a great drifting ship. Well, I was, strangely, at the helm! This came home to me when, two days later, I drove over with Flora to meet, as Mrs. Grose said, the little gentleman; and all the more\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"envy of the comparative dusk of the pew and of the almost spiritual help of the hassock on which I might bend my knees. I seemed literally to be running a race with some confusion to which he was about to reduce me, but I felt that he had got in first when, before we had even entered the churchyard, he threw out\\u2014 \\u201cI want my own sort!\\u201d It literally made me bound forward. \\u201cThere are not many of your own sort, Miles!\\u201d I laughed. \\u201cUnless perhaps dear little Flora!\\u201d \\u201cYou really compare me to a baby girl?\\u201d This found\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"than Miles has alluded to his expulsion. Oh, yes, we may sit here and look at them, and they may show off to us there to their fill; but even while they pretend to be lost in their fairytale they\\u2019re steeped in their vision of the dead restored. He\\u2019s not reading to her,\\u201d I declared; \\u201cthey\\u2019re talking of them\\u2014they\\u2019re talking horrors! I go on, I know, as if I were crazy; and it\\u2019s a wonder I\\u2019m not. What I\\u2019ve seen would have made you so; but it has only made me more lucid, made me get hold of still other\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"something much worse.\\u201d \\u201cWorse than dislike?\\u201d\\u2014this left her indeed at a loss. \\u201cWith a determination\\u2014indescribable. With a kind of fury of intention.\\u201d I made her turn pale. \\u201cIntention?\\u201d \\u201cTo get hold of her.\\u201d Mrs. Grose\\u2014her eyes just lingering on mine\\u2014gave a shudder and walked to the window; and while she stood there looking out I completed my statement. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what Flora knows.\\u201d After a little she turned round. \\u201cThe person was in black, you say?\\u201d \\u201cIn mourning\\u2014rather poor, almost shabby. But\\u2014yes\\u2014with extraordinary beauty.\\u201d I now recognized to what I had at last, stroke by stroke, brought the victim of my\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think your uncle much cares.\\u201d Miles, on this, stood looking at me. \\u201cThen don\\u2019t you think he can be made to?\\u201d \\u201cIn what way?\\u201d \\u201cWhy, by his coming down.\\u201d \\u201cBut who\\u2019ll get him to come down?\\u201d \\u201cI will!\\u201d the boy said with extraordinary brightness and emphasis. He gave me another look charged with that expression and then marched off alone into church. The business was practically settled from the moment I never followed him. It was a pitiful surrender to agitation, but my being aware of this had somehow no power to restore me. I only sat there\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"and its agitation. The usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the house, but I had an intimate conviction that, wherever Flora might be, she was not near home. She had not given me the slip for any small adventure, and, since the day of the very great one that I had shared with her by the pond, I had been aware, in our walks, of the quarter to which she most inclined. This was why I had now given to Mrs. Grose\\u2019s steps so marked a direction\\u2014a direction that made her, when she perceived it, oppose a\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"still with her eyes. \\u201cOf what other things have you got hold?\\u201d \\u201cWhy, of the very things that have delighted, fascinated, and yet, at bottom, as I now so strangely see, mystified and troubled me. Their more than earthly beauty, their absolutely unnatural goodness. It\\u2019s a game,\\u201d I went on; \\u201cit\\u2019s a policy and a fraud!\\u201d \\u201cOn the part of little darlings\\u2014?\\u201d \\u201cAs yet mere lovely babies? Yes, mad as that seems!\\u201d The very act of bringing it out really helped me to trace it\\u2014follow it all up and piece it all together. \\u201cThey haven\\u2019t been good\\u2014they\\u2019ve only been absent.\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"thing I could actively cultivate, and it may be imagined if I neglected now to address myself to this source for whatever it would yield. Stranger than I can express, certainly, was the effort to struggle against my new lights; it would doubtless have been, however, a greater tension still had it not been so frequently successful. I used to wonder how my little charges could help guessing that I thought strange things about them; and the circumstances that these things only made them more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to keeping them in the dark. I\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"we must clutch at that\\u2014we must cling to it! If it isn\\u2019t a proof of what you say, it\\u2019s a proof of\\u2014God knows what! For the woman\\u2019s a horror of horrors.\\u201d Mrs. Grose, at this, fixed her eyes a minute on the ground; then at last raising them, \\u201cTell me how you know,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThen you admit it\\u2019s what she was?\\u201d I cried. \\u201cTell me how you know,\\u201d my friend simply repeated. \\u201cKnow? By seeing her! By the way she looked.\\u201d \\u201cAt you, do you mean\\u2014so wickedly?\\u201d \\u201cDear me, no\\u2014I could have borne that. She gave me never a\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"whatever, in me, was most excitable. The best way to picture it all is to say that I was off my guard. They gave me so little trouble\\u2014they were of a gentleness so extraordinary. I used to speculate\\u2014but even this with a dim disconnectedness\\u2014as to how the rough future (for all futures are rough!) would handle them and might bruise them. They had the bloom of health and happiness; and yet, as if I had been in charge of a pair of little grandees, of princes of the blood, for whom everything, to be right, would have to be enclosed\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"days were long; they often, at their finest, gave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my pupils, teatime and bedtime having come and gone, I had, before my final retirement, a small interval alone. Much as I liked my companions, this hour was the thing in the day I liked most; and I liked it best of all when, as the light faded\\u2014or rather, I should say, the day lingered and the last calls of the last birds sounded, in a flushed sky, from the old trees\\u2014I could take a turn into the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"of admonition. Whatever he had been driven from school for, it was not for ugly feeding. He was irreproachable, as always, today; but he was unmistakably more conscious. He was discernibly trying to take for granted more things than he found, without assistance, quite easy; and he dropped into peaceful silence while he felt his situation. Our meal was of the briefest\\u2014mine a vain pretense, and I had the things immediately removed. While this was done Miles stood again with his hands in his little pockets and his back to me\\u2014stood and looked out of the wide window through which,\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"mean the face was\\u2014when, on the first of these occasions, at the end of a long June day, I stopped short on emerging from one of the plantations and coming into view of the house. What arrested me on the spot\\u2014and with a shock much greater than any vision had allowed for\\u2014was the sense that my imagination had, in a flash, turned real. He did stand there!\\u2014but high up, beyond the lawn and at the very top of the tower to which, on that first morning, little Flora had conducted me. This tower was one of a pair\\u2014square, incongruous, crenelated\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"I have you,\\u201d I launched at the beast, \\u201cbut he has lost you forever!\\u201d Then, for the demonstration of my work, \\u201cThere, there!\\u201d I said to Miles. But he had already jerked straight round, stared, glared again, and seen but the quiet day. With the stroke of the loss I was so proud of he uttered the cry of a creature hurled over an abyss, and the grasp with which I recovered him might have been that of catching him in his fall. I caught him, yes, I held him\\u2014it may be imagined with what a passion; but at the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"that had breathed on me the night of my arrival and which, much lighter then, as I have mentioned, I should probably have made little of in memory had my subsequent sojourn been less agitated. I had not gone to bed; I sat reading by a couple of candles. There was a roomful of old books at Bly\\u2014last-century fiction, some of it, which, to the extent of a distinctly deprecated renown, but never to so much as that of a stray specimen, had reached the sequestered home and appealed to the unavowed curiosity of my youth. I remember that the\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"in unison, below us, over the lawn, the boy, as they went, reading aloud from a storybook and passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch. Mrs. Grose watched them with positive placidity; then I caught the suppressed intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to take from me a view of the back of the tapestry. I had made her a receptacle of lurid things, but there was an odd recognition of my superiority\\u2014my accomplishments and my function\\u2014in her patience under my pain. She offered her mind to my disclosures as, had I wished to\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"ever been \\u2018bad\\u2019? He has not literally \\u2018ever,\\u2019 in these weeks that I myself have lived with him and so closely watched him; he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of delightful, lovable goodness. Therefore you might perfectly have made the claim for him if you had not, as it happened, seen an exception to take. What was your exception, and to what passage in your personal observation of him did you refer?\\u201d It was a dreadfully austere inquiry, but levity was not our note, and, at any rate, before the gray dawn admonished us to separate I had got\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"doubt that I had seen exactly what I had seen. To hold her perfectly in the pinch of that, I found I had only to ask her how, if I had \\u201cmade it up,\\u201d I came to be able to give, of each of the persons appearing to me, a picture disclosing, to the last detail, their special marks\\u2014a portrait on the exhibition of which she had instantly recognized and named them. She wished of course\\u2014small blame to her!\\u2014to sink the whole subject; and I was quick to assure her that my own interest in it had now violently taken\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"as a blazing fire! Only look, dearest woman, look\\u2014!\\u201d She looked, even as I did, and gave me, with her deep groan of negation, repulsion, compassion\\u2014the mixture with her pity of her relief at her exemption\\u2014a sense, touching to me even then, that she would have backed me up if she could. I might well have needed that, for with this hard blow of the proof that her eyes were hopelessly sealed I felt my own situation horribly crumble, I felt\\u2014I saw\\u2014my livid predecessor press, from her position, on my defeat, and I was conscious, more than all, of what\"],\n [\"d\",\n\"you know?\\u201d \\u201cI know, I know, I know!\\u201d My exaltation grew. \\u201cAnd you know, my dear!\\u201d She didn\\u2019t deny this, but I required, I felt, not even so much telling as that. She resumed in a moment, at any rate: \\u201cWhat if he should see him?\\u201d \\u201cLittle Miles? That\\u2019s what he wants!\\u201d She looked immensely scared again. \\u201cThe child?\\u201d \\u201cHeaven forbid! The man. He wants to appear to them.\\u201d That he might was an awful conception, and yet, somehow, I could keep it at bay; which, moreover, as we lingered there, was what I succeeded in practically proving. I had\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"but little food and {50} the evidence of his suffering was pitiful. In fact, he stirred our feelings to such a pitch we at length closed the windows to shut out the sounds of his mournful calls. Upon looking out next morning, the first note we heard was that of a Bluebird, but his voice seemed to have lost some of its sorrow. Walking around the corner of the house, I found him sitting on a limb near the box. Two feet from him sat another Bluebird\\u2014a female. At eleven o'clock we saw her clinging to the side of the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"birds; and a winged creature, so dusky that it could have been intended for nothing but a Crow, reposed among the curls and braids of her hair.\\\" Ah, those were the halcyon days of the feather trade! Now and then a voice cried out at the slaughter, or hands were raised at the sight of the horrible shambles, but there were no laws to prevent the killing nor was there any strong public sentiment to demand its cessation, while on the other hand more riches yet lay in store for the hunter and the merchant. There were no laws whatever\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"months in order to give all dissatisfied parties an opportunity to be heard. The whole idea of the Government taking over the matter of protecting migratory birds, as well as the startling character of some of the regulations promulgated by the committee was justly expected to bring forth either great shouts of approbation or a storm of disapproval, and possibly both sounds might be heard. As long experience has shown that it is necessary to have public opinion approve of a game law if it is to be effective, one can well understand that, following the mailing of the circular\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"every bird he could see. Recently this same boy came to me with a bird that was hurt, and in a most sympathetic tone said: 'Who do you suppose could have been mean enough to hurt this dear little bird?' Our study of birds in the Junior Audubon Class brought about this change in the boy.\\\" Junior Game Protectors.\\u2014Another leader reported from Nashville that the one thousand junior members in the schools there had turned into voluntary bird wardens, and spied upon every man or boy who went afield with a gun. In a number of places the juniors have\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"with slight modifications. Nothing came of this any more than of the bill that he started going in 1909. In 1911 he again brought forward this pet measure toward which Congress had so often turned a cold shoulder. Senator George P. McLean set a similar bill afloat in the troubled waters of the Senate. Nothing happened, however, until the spring of 1912, when committee hearings were given on these bills in both branches of Congress. Representatives of more than thirty organizations interested in conservation appeared and eloquently sought to impress the national lawmakers with the importance and desirability of the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"and one-half million acres of the finest wheat to be found in the Middle West, and wheat land dropped 40 per cent. in value. Closing this Year Book, with its long tables of discouraging statements, we may find more cheerful reading if we turn to another Agricultural Department publication entitled, \\\"Some Common Birds and Their Relation to Agriculture; Farmers Bulletin number Fifty-four.\\\" We need peruse only a few pages to become impressed with the fact that our Government Biological Survey has made an {105} exhaustive and exceedingly thorough investigation of the feeding habits of the wild birds that frequent the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"good idea to sit silently for a time on some log or stump, and soon the birds will come about you, for they seldom notice a person who is motionless. A great aid to field study is a good Field Glass. A glass enables one to see the colours of small birds hopping about the shrubbery, or moving through the branches of trees. With its {9} aid one may learn much of their movements, and even observe the kind of food they consume. A very serviceable glass may be secured at a price varying from five to ten dollars. The\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"of the land affecting migratory birds. To the United States Biological Survey was intrusted the task of enforcing the law by means of game wardens and other officials. That is, the survey was to collect the evidence in cases of violations, and the prosecutions were to be conducted {187} by the Department of Justice. To enable these officials to execute the law, Congress has appropriated $50,000 annually\\u2014which is just about one tenth the minimum amount needed for the purpose. This paltry sum has been expended as judiciously as possible with marked results for good. Trouble, however, soon developed in the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"country are erected every year for the accommodation of these interesting birds. By their cheerful twitterings and their vigilance in driving from the neighbourhood every Hawk and Crow that ventures near, they not only repay the slight effort made in their behalf, but endear themselves to the thrifty chicken-raising farm-wives of the country. If gourds or boxes cannot be found Martins will sometimes build about the eaves of buildings or similar places. They have learned that it is wise to nest near human habitations. At Plant City, Florida, one may find their nests in the large electric arc-lights swinging in\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"as an untrained boy could cut out with a hatchet. A dozen gourds, each with a large hole in the side, completed the tenements for this well-contented Martin community. Some Rules for Making and Erecting Bird Boxes.\\u2014Here are a few simple rules on the making and placing of bird boxes: 1. In all nest boxes, except those designed for Martins, the opening should be several inches above the floor, thus conforming to the general plan of a Woodpecker's hole, or natural cavity in a tree. 2. As a rule nest boxes should be erected on poles from ten to thirty\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"miles away from any friendly chimney. Some day I hope to revisit the region and find this natural nesting hollow still occupied by a pair of unmodernized Swifts. The traffic in the feathers of American birds for the millinery trade began to develop strongly about 1880 and assumed its greatest proportions during the next ten years. The wholesale milliners whose business and pleasure it was to supply these ornaments for women's hats naturally turned for their supply first to those species of birds most easily procured. Agents were soon going about the country looking for men to kill birds for\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"and fragments of brightly coloured yarns were placed where the birds could find them. Baron von Berlepsch, whose experiments in attracting birds to his place in Germany have been widely advertised, found that when the tops of bushes were drawn in closely by means of a wire or cord, the resulting thick mass of leaves and twigs offered so fine a place for concealing nests that few birds could resist the temptation to use them. Other means of rendering a cemetery alluring to nesting birds will readily present themselves when an active interest is developed in the subject. A little\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"many responsible manufacturers that may be recommended are: The Crescent Company, \\\"Birdville,\\\" Toms River, New Jersey; Pinedale Bird Nesting Box Company, Wareham, Massachusetts; The Audubon Bird House Company, Meriden, New Hampshire; Maplewood Biologica Laboratory, Stamford, Connecticut; Jacobs Bird House Company, 404 South Washington St., Waynesburg, Pa.; Decker Brothers, Rhinebeck, New York; Winthrop Packard, Canton, Massachusetts. It is not necessary, however, to buy boxes to put {220} up for birds. Equally useful ones can be made in the Manual Training Department of any school, or in the basement or woodshed at home. If you do not know how to begin, you\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the Association, at a cost of thirteen thousand dollars, enrolled 29,369 school children under the standard bearing the inscription \\\"Protect the Birds.\\\" The movement has continued to grow, and up to June 1, 1916, there had been formed 27,873 classes with a total membership of 559,840 children. The Association is annually expending on this work {247} $25,000 more than the children's fees amount to. Of this amount Mrs. Sage continues to contribute one-fifth, the remaining four-fifths being given by an anonymous friend of children and birds. In supplying these pupils and their teachers with the necessary pictures, leaflets, and outline\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"who sailed near might read. Imagine the chagrin of the Audubon workers upon learning from their warden that when the Pelicans returned that season to occupy the island as before, they took one look at this declaration of the President and immediately departed, one and all, to a neighbouring island entirely outside of the reservation! Signs less alarming in size were substituted, and the Pelicans, their feelings appeased, condescended to return, and have since dwelt peacefully under the protecting care of the Government.

Speaking of some of the things he saw here, he says, \\\"A Fox Sparrow ate one hundred and three seeds in two minutes and forty-seven seconds; another, one {112} hundred and ten in three minutes, forty-five seconds; while still another Song Sparrow ate one hundred and fifty-four in the same length of time.

With the limited means at its command the work of ornithological exploration was carried forward. Every island, mud flat, and sand bar along the coast of the Mexican {196} Gulf, from Texas to Key West, was visited by trained ornithologists who reported their findings to the New York office. These were forwarded to Washington for the approval of Dr. T. S. Palmer of the Biological Survey, and Frank Bond, of the General Land Office, where executive orders were prepared for the President's signature.

Amateur Feather Hunters.\\u2014Quite aside from the professional millinery feather hunter there should be mentioned the criminal slaughter of birds which has been indulged in by individuals who have killed them for the uses of their own lady friends. I know one Brown Pelican colony which was visited by a tourist who shot four hundred of the big, harmless, inoffensive creatures in order to get a small strip of skin on either side of the body.\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"photograph while you are thus engaged. On one occasion I removed a Turkey Vulture's egg from beneath the sitting bird. It merely hissed feebly as I approached, and a moment later humbly laid at my feet a portion of the carrion which it had eaten a short time before\\u2014a well-meant but not wholly appreciated peace-offering. Lessons to Be Learned.\\u2014An infinite variety of interesting things may be learned by watching birds at their nests, or by a study of the nests themselves. How many persons have ever tried to answer seriously the old conundrum: \\\"How many straws go to make a\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"friendly terms. This is the only species of North American birds that exhibits such depravity. All other birds display great willingness to attend to their home duties, and often give evidence of keen delight while so engaged. One of the most exquisite and dainty forms of bird life found in the United States is the little Blue-gray Gnatcatcher. When occupied in building the nest, which is usually saddled on the limb of some forest tree, the birds call to each other constantly; and even after the eggs are laid there is no attempt to restrain their expressions of happiness. Unlike\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"life of birds which is quite so distinctive. The extent and duration of their migrations are among the most wonderful phenomena of the natural world. Ornithologists have gathered much information regarding their coming and going, but knowledge on many of the points involved is incomplete. It is only of recent years that the nest of the Solitary Sandpiper has been found, and yet this is a very common bird in the eastern United States in certain seasons. Where is the scientist who can yet tell us in what country the common Chimney Swift {63} passes the winter, or over what\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"average. Individuals will at times pause and remain for a few days in a favourable locality before proceeding farther. When large bodies of water are encountered longer flights are of course necessary, for land birds cannot rest on the water as their feathers would soon become water-soaked and drowning would result. Multitudes of small birds, including even the little Ruby-throated Hummingbird, annually cross the Gulf of Mexico at a single flight. This necessitates a continuous journey of from five hundred to seven hundred miles. Some North American birds migrate southward only a few hundred miles to pass the winter, while\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"Swallows.\\u2014During a period of seven years more than 500,000 Terns', or Sea Swallows', skins were collected in spring and summer in the sounds of North and South Carolina. These figures I compiled from the records and accounts given me by men who did the killing. Their method was to fit out small sailing vessels on which they could live comfortably and cruise for several weeks; in fact, they were usually out during the entire three months of the nesting period. That was the time of year that offered best rewards for such work, for then the birds' {142} feathers bore\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"there is wide variety in the character of the nests of different species classified as belonging to the same family. The Flycatcher group is a good example of this fact. Here we have as one member of the family the Kingbird, that makes a heavy bulky nest often on one of the upper, outermost limbs of an apple tree. The Wood Pewee's nest is a frail, shallow excuse for a nest, resting securely on a horizontal limb of some well-grown tree. Then there is the Phoebe, that plasters its cup-shaped mass of nesting material with mud, thus securing it to\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"birds were on their way to their northern breeding grounds. Some states adopted this measure and the results bore out the predictions of those who urged the passage of such laws. New York State, for example, tried the experiment, and within two years thousands of Black Ducks were breeding where for a long time they had not been known to occur in summer. So the feeling became general among bird protectors that it would be an excellent thing if spring shooting of all migratory game birds should be stopped everywhere. But the legislatures of many states paid small heed to\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"he could between the lives of the birds he loved and the insatiable greed of Fashion. The best place to study wild birds is on a reservation, for there birds have greatly lost their fear of man, and primitive conditions have been largely restored. In one of the southern sea-bird colonies I have photographed Royal Terns standing unafraid on the sands not twelve feet distant. They had become so accustomed to the warden in charge that they had regained their confidence in man. At Lake Worth I saw a gentleman feed Scaup Ducks that swam to within two yards of\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"which it is held. It gathers its food almost entirely from the ground, being different in this respect from other Woodpeckers. One may flush it in the grove, the forest, the peanut field, or the untilled prairie, and everywhere it is found engaged in the most highly satisfactory occupation of destroying insect life. More than half of its food consists of ants. In this country, taken as a whole, Flickers are very numerous, and the millions of individual birds which have yet escaped the guns of degenerate pot hunters constitute a mighty army of destruction to the Formicidae. Let us\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"to name the bird for a student upon being told its approximate size and the character of its flight. Who can see a Wild Duck swimming, or a Gull flying, without at once referring it to the group of birds to which it belongs? Thus the first step is taken toward learning the names of the species, and the grouping of them into families. Artificial Cover in Hiding.\\u2014When studying the larger or the shyer species it is sometimes well to hide one's self from view with whatever articles are at hand that resemble the natural surroundings. This may be done\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"who had been accustomed to seek pleasure afield with gun and decoys? No, indeed, banish the thought, for it is written that so long as man shall live, Wild Duck shall grace his table and gratify his palate. The remarkable changes which had so affected the fortunes of the wild fowl were due to the enactment of a United States law known as the Federal Migratory Game Law. Let us see something of this law and of what led to its establishment. History of Game Laws.\\u2014When the United States of America became a free and independent nation the lawmakers in\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"and secure from all the terrors of earth. There is no pain whatever attached to the taking of Ostrich feathers, for they are merely clipped from the bird by means of scissors. A month or two later when the stubs of the quills have become dry they are readily picked from the wings without injury to the new feathers. The Ostrich industry is good and it is worthy of encouragement. No woman need fear that she is aiding in any way the destruction of birds by wearing Ostrich plumes. There are many more of the birds {166} in the world\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"captures many insects disturbed into activity by the movements of the browsing animals. The Cowbird lays its eggs in the nests of various other birds, distributing them about the neighbourhood. Here they are left to be hatched and the young to be reared by the foster parents. Cowbird's eggs have been found in the nests of nearly one hundred species of birds, and nearly always the nest of some smaller bird is chosen. Despite this fact the Cowbird's eggs are often first to hatch. The young grow rapidly and, being strong and aggressive, not only secure the lion's share of\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"beauty to the eye; but to my mind there is always something flat and insipid about a landscape lacking the music of singing birds. Therefore I looked and listened for my feathered friends. Some English Sparrows flew up from the drive, and I heard the rusty hinge-like notes of a small company of Purple Crackles that were nesting, I suspected, in the pine trees down the slope, but of really cheerful bird life there appeared to be none in this artificially beautified, forty-acre enclosure. There is no reason to suppose that, under normal conditions, birds would shun a cemetery any\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"of insects, and the number of individuals in some cases run into the thousands. Nighthawks also eat grasshoppers, potato-beetles, cucumber-beetles, boll-weevils, leaf-hoppers, and numerous gnats and {107} mosquitoes. Surely this splendid representative of the Goatsucker family deserves the gratitude of all American citizens. Among the branches of certain of our fruit trees we sometimes see large webs which have been made by the tent caterpillars. An invading host seems to have pitched its tents among the boughs on all sides. If undisturbed these caterpillars strip the foliage from the trees. Fortunately there is a bird which is very fond of\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"than any general far-reaching bird-protective measure, which has been enacted in this country. For the purpose of the regulations, migratory game birds were defined as Ducks, Geese, Swans, Rails, Coots, Pigeons, Cranes, and shore birds, which included Plover, Snipe, Woodcock, and Sandpipers. Migratory insectivorous birds were enumerated as Thrushes, Orioles, Larks, Swallows, Wrens, {183} Woodpeckers, and all other perching birds that feed entirely or chiefly on insects. Having thus conveniently classified migratory birds into two easily comprehensible and distinguishable groups, the way was open to deal with them separately and distinctively. Therefore, after declaring it to be illegal to kill\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"scratched in the earth, usually in an open field or on a rocky hillside. The only lining is a few grass blades or smooth pebbles. To protect them from enemies the birds depend much upon the peculiar marking of the eggs, which makes them look like the {40} ground on which they lie, and this seems to be a sufficient safeguard for the eggs and offspring of the species. The Nighthawk lays her two eggs on the bare ground in a field or open woods; and the Whip-poor-will's nest is on the fallen leaves of a thicket at any spot\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"women's hats naturally turned for their supply first to those species of birds most easily procured. Agents were soon going about the country looking for men to kill birds for their feathers, and circulars and hand bills offering attractive prices for feathers of various kinds were mailed broadcast. The first great onslaughts were made on the breeding colonies of sea birds along the Atlantic Coast. On Long Island there were some very large communities of Terns and these were {141} quickly raided. The old birds were shot down and the unattended young necessarily were left to starve. Along the coast\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"to man's interests. First Federal Bird Reservation\\u2014Shortly afterward the Audubon Society friends employed a man to protect from the raids of tourists and feather hunters a {191} large colony of Brown Pelicans that used for nesting purposes a small, muddy, mangrove-covered island in Indian River on the Atlantic Coast. Soon murmurings began to be heard. \\\"Pelicans eat fish and should not be protected,\\\" declared one Floridan. \\\"We need Pelican quills to sell to the feather dealers,\\\" chimed in another with a keen eye to the main chance. There was talk of repealing the law at the next session of the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the importance and desirability of the measure. Both bills were intended for the protection of migratory game birds only, but the representative of the National Association of Audubon Societies urged that the bills be extended to include all migratory insect-eating birds, because of their value to agriculture. This suggestion was adopted and after a stiff fight in Congress the McLean Bill became a law on March 4, 1913. This new federal statute did not in itself change any of the existing game laws, but it gave authority to certain functionaries to make such regulations as they deemed wise, necessary, and\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"mean a magnificent fortune. The warden is fully alive to this fact, and is ever on the alert. Many of the plume hunters are desperate men, and he never knows what moment he may need to grasp his rifle to defend his life in the shadows of the Big Cypress, where alligators and vultures would make short shrift of his remains. He remembers, as he goes his rounds among the birds day by day, or lies in his tent at night, that a {213} little way to the south, on a lonely sand key, lies buried Guy Bradley, who was\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"wild fowl is drawing to a glorious conclusion. To-day, in the history of wild-life conservation, we have before us the unusual spectacle of the United States Government taking a serious hand in a problem which had been found to be too difficult of solution by the different states working separately. Many of us believe this predicts a brighter day for the perpetuation of the wild life of our country. The creation of reservations where wild birds can be protected at all times is a modern idea, brought prominently to public attention by the efforts of the Audubon Society. The first\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"of nearly twenty thousand cankerworm moth eggs destroyed by four birds in a few minutes. The Chickadee is very fond of the eggs of this moth and hunts them assiduously during the four weeks of the summer when the moths are laying them. The Nighthawk, which feeds mainly in the evening, and which is equally at home in the pine barrens of Florida, the prairies of Dakota, or the upper air of New York City, is a slaughterer of insects of many kinds. A Government agent collected one, in the stomach of which were the remains of thirty-four May beetles,\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"New York, and still another at Greenwich, Connecticut. Birdcraft Sanctuary.\\u2014The best equipped of this class of community bird refuges, as distinguished from private estates, or Audubon Society, State, or Federal bird reservations, is Birdcraft Sanctuary in Fairfield, Connecticut, a tract of ten acres presented to the Connecticut Audubon Society in June, 1914. Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright, President of the Connecticut Society, has written that in the creation of this sanctuary it was decided that certain requirements were necessary: \\\"A cat-proof fence to surround the entire place. That it may not look aggressive, it should be set well inside the picturesque\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"know one Brown Pelican colony which was visited by a tourist who shot four hundred of the big, harmless, inoffensive creatures in order to get a small strip of skin on either side of the body. He explained to his boatmen, who did the skinning for him, that he was curious to see if these strips of skin with their feathers would not {154} make an interesting coat for his wife. The birds killed were all caring for their young in the nests at the time he and his hirelings shot them. There was a few years ago, in a\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"feathers of some kind. Of the one hundred and fifty-eight remaining, seventy-two were worn by young or middle-aged ladies, and eighty-six by ladies in mourning or elderly ladies.\\\" This was a period when people seemed to go mad on the subject of wearing birds and feathers. They were used for feminine adornment in almost every conceivable fashion. Here are two quotations from New York daily papers of that time, only the names {148} of the ladies are changed: \\\"Miss Jones looked extremely well in white with a whole nest of sparkling, scintillating birds in her hair which it would have\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"of all that vast country lying between the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay on the east and the mountains of the Far West, constitute the principal nursery of North American waterfowl, whence, in autumn, come the flocks of Ducks and Geese that in winter darken the Southern {70} sounds and lakes. One stream moves down the Pacific Coast, another follows the Mississippi Valley to the marshes of Louisiana and Texas, while a third passes diagonally across the country in a southeasterly direction until it reaches the Maryland and Virginia coastline. Thence the birds disperse along the coastal country from Maine\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"Pelicans returned that season to occupy the island as before, they took one look at this declaration of the President and immediately departed, one and all, to a neighbouring island entirely outside of the reservation! Signs less alarming in size were substituted, and the Pelicans, their feelings appeased, condescended to return, and have since dwelt peacefully under the protecting care of the Government. Congressional Sanction.\\u2014In view of the fact that some persons contended that the President had over-stepped his authority in making a bird reservation, a law was drafted, and passed by Congress, specifically {193} giving protection to birds on\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the only bird in the world which has been domesticated {163} exclusively for its feather product. These birds were formerly found wild in Arabia, southwestern Persia, and practically the whole of Africa. In diminishing numbers they are still to be met with in these regions, especially in the unsettled parts of Africa north of the Orange River. From early times the plumes of these avian giants have been in demand for head decorations, and for centuries the people of Asia and Africa killed the birds for this purpose. They were captured chiefly by means of pitfalls, for a long-legged bird\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"exhaustively of the classification of birds, as well as of form, colour, distribution, migration, songs, and foods. Here an attempt is made to place before the reader a brief consideration of these and many similar topics, and suggest lines of action and thought that may perhaps stimulate a fuller study of the subject. Attention is also given to the relation of birds to mankind and the effect of civilisation on the bird-life of the country. The book is not intended so much for the advanced student in ornithology, as for the beginner. Its purpose is to answer many of the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the corn. In return for these attentions the ants feast upon the honey-like substances secreted by these aphids. The ants, which have the reputation of being no sluggards, take good care of their diminutive milch cattle, and will tenderly pick them up and transport them to new pastures when the old ones fail. Late in the summer they carefully collect all the aphid eggs that are obtainable, and taking them into their nests keep them safe during the winter. When spring comes and the eggs hatch, the ants gather the young plant lice and place them on plants. It may\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"ones must be sacrificed, for from the standpoint of the killers it is better that a few men should become enriched by bird slaughter than that many people should derive pleasure from the birds which add so much beauty and interest to the landscape. Change of Nesting Habits.\\u2014The nesting habits of some birds have been revolutionized by the coming of civilization to the American wilderness. The Swallow family provides three notable examples of this. The Cliff Swallow and Barn Swallow that formerly built their nests on exposed cliffs now seek the shelter of barns and other outbuildings for this purpose.\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"for an increased number of other species of wild life. Effect of Forest Devastation.\\u2014Only in a comparatively few cases has bird life suffered from the destruction of forests. In parts of the Middle West the Woodpeckers have no doubt decreased in {128} numbers. There are places where one may travel for many miles without seeing a single grove in which these birds could live. Passenger Pigeons as late as 1870 were frequently seen in enormous flocks. Their numbers during the periods of migration was one of the greatest ornithological wonders of the world. Now the birds are gone. What is\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"thousands of dollars annually for the enforcement of a law which is purely sentimental in its nature. It is clear, therefore, that our law makers regard the wild bird life as {102} a great value to the country from the standpoint of dollars and cents. Destructiveness of Insects.\\u2014If we go back a few years and examine certain widely read publications issued by the United States Department of Agriculture, we can understand more fully why our legislative bodies have regarded so seriously the subject of bird protection. In one of the Year Books of the Department we read that the annual\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"from a body of water, over the surface of which it can paddle and flap for many rods, and as {78} there was no pond or lake in all the neighbouring country, the Loon's fate was evident from the first. Birds are often swept to sea by storm winds from off shore. Vainly they beat against the gale or fly on quivering wings before its blast, until the hungry waves swallow their weary bodies. One morning in northern Lake Michigan I found a Connecticut Warbler lying dead on the deck beneath my stateroom window after a stormy night of wind\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the Maryland and Virginia coastline. Thence the birds disperse along the coastal country from Maine to Florida. The Travelling Shore Birds.\\u2014Turnstones, Sanderlings, Curlews, and other denizens of the beaches and salt marshes migrate in great numbers along our Atlantic Coast. Some of them winter in the United States, and others pass on to the West Indies and southward. The extent of the annual journeys undertaken by some of these birds is indeed marvellous. Admiral Peary has told me that he found shore birds on the most northern land, where it slopes down into the Arctic Sea, less than five hundred\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"to be hatched and the young to be reared by the foster parents. Cowbird's eggs have been found in the nests of nearly one hundred species of birds, and nearly always the nest of some smaller bird is chosen. Despite this fact the Cowbird's eggs are often first to hatch. The young grow rapidly and, being strong and aggressive, not only secure the lion's share of the food, but frequently crowd the young of the rightful owner out of the nest to perish on the ground beneath. As soon as the young leave the nest the greedy Cowbird follows the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"and five female cankerworm moths. With scalpel, tweezers, and microscope these moths were examined, {106} and each was found to contain on an average one hundred and eighty-five eggs. This gives a total of nearly twenty thousand cankerworm moth eggs destroyed by four birds in a few minutes. The Chickadee is very fond of the eggs of this moth and hunts them assiduously during the four weeks of the summer when the moths are laying them. The Nighthawk, which feeds mainly in the evening, and which is equally at home in the pine barrens of Florida, the prairies of Dakota,\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"with their quiet brown female owners, often appear to be watched over by one shining, iridescent lord Crackle, who may be husband to them all. He guards his own with jealous care. Evidently, too, he desires the whole country to know that he is the most handsome, ferocious bird on the earth; for all day long his hoarse shoutings may be heard, and when he launches into the air, the sound of the ponderous beating of his wings can, on a still day, be heard half a mile away, across the lake. One of the best-known polygamous birds of North\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"paid salaries, in others they receive only a per diem wage or receive certain fees for convictions. License {171} fees are usually required of hunters, and the moneys thus collected form the basis of a fund used for paying the wardens and meeting the other expenses incident to the game law enforcement. The Lacey Law.\\u2014The Federal Government is taking a share of the responsibility in preserving the wild life of the Union. On July 2, 1897, Congressman Lacey introduced in the House a bill to prohibit the export of big game from some of the Western States. In 1909 amendments\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"on this the young feed at infrequent intervals. Sometimes several hours pass between the visits of the food-laden parents, but the supply is usually adequate when at length it arrives. Sharing the Labours.\\u2014Most young birds, however, are fed with great frequency. For more than an hour one day the writer watched a pair of Georgia Mockingbirds feeding their young. The one that appeared to be the female visited the nest with food on an average once every two minutes, and the male {46} made a similar trip about once in twelve minutes. He could have done better had he not\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the shooting of these birds become that many baymen gave up their usual occupation of sailing pleasure parties and became gunners. These men often earned as much as one hundred dollars a week for their skill with the shotgun. It is not surprising that at the end of the season a local observer reported: \\\"One cannot help noticing now the scarcity of Terns on the New Jersey coast, and it is all owing to their merciless destruction.\\\" One might go further and give the sickening details of how the birds were swept from the mud flats about the mouth of\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"species that survive to enjoy the summer. The Food Question in Winter.\\u2014Where to secure the food is the big question which confronts every bird when it opens its eyes on the first snowy morning of winter. Not only has the whole aspect of the country been changed, but the old sources of food have passed away. Not a caterpillar is to be found on the dead leaves, and not a winged insect is left to come flying {87} by; hence other food must be looked for in new directions. Emboldened by hunger, the Starlings alight at the kitchen door, and\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"mainly in swamps, and in our Southern States there are extensive lowland regions that remain practically untouched by the axeman. For some reason, however, the birds have been unable to withstand the advance of civilization, and like the Paroquet, the disappearance of which is almost equally difficult to explain, it will soon be numbered with the lengthening list of species that have passed away. The Commercializing of Birds.\\u2014With the exceptions noted above the birds that have noticeably decreased in numbers in North America are those on whose heads a price has been set by the markets. Let a demand once\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"indeed, is the eye of the man or woman that can distinguish it from a knot on a limb. Although the Hummingbird's nest is exceedingly frail, there is nothing on record to show that {30} any great number of them come to grief during the summer rains. It is, however, not called upon for a long term of occupation. Within a month after the two white eggs are laid the young depart on their tiny pinions. Young birds that require a longer period for growth before leaving the nest are furnished usually with more enduring abiding places. {31} In the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"five-sixths of the food which the young require. Her method of procedure is first to permit her mate to search for a suitable nesting site. When some sheltered spot in the ground, quite to her liking, has been found she deposits the eggs and goes her way. Little companies of female Phalaropes may be seen at this time of the year frequenting the ponds and sloughs they inhabit. The dutiful and well-trained males are all at home, where they are responsible for the entire task of caring for, and incubating, the eggs. Length of Mated Life.\\u2014The length of time which\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"its blood registers over a hundred degrees. It is a simple fact of biology, therefore, that a tremendous amount of nourishing food is necessary for the bird's existence. Vast quantities of insects are needed for this purpose. Some time ago a New England gentleman became so impressed by the frequency with which a pair of Robins visited their nest with food for the young that he determined to learn more about the food-consuming {242} possibilities of the four nestlings. The day the offspring left their cradle he temporarily took possession of them. With the aid of some friends, who kindly\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"reservations in the original thirteen colonies. The reason is that there are no Government waste lands containing bird colonies in these states. To protect the colony-breeding birds found there other means were necessary. The Audubon Society employs annually about sixty agents to guard in summer the more important groups of water birds along the Atlantic Coast and about some of the lakes of the interior. Water-bird colonies are usually situated on islands where the birds are comparatively free from the attacks of natural enemies; hence the question of guarding them resolves itself mainly into the question of keeping people from\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"1914. Despite the generally accepted statement that these birds succumbed to the guns, snares, and nets of hunters, there is a second cause which doubtless had its effect in hastening the disappearance of the species. The cutting away of vast forests where the birds were accustomed to gather and feed on mast greatly restricted their feeding range. They collected in enormous colonies for the purpose of rearing their young, and after the forests of the Northern States were so largely destroyed the birds seem to have been driven far up into Canada, quite {129} beyond their usual breeding range. Here,\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"loudly to a companion, stepping upon brittle twigs, and crashing through the underbrush. Go quietly, stopping to listen every few steps. Make no violent motions, as such actions often frighten a bird more than a noise. Do not wear brightly coloured clothing, but garments of neutral tones which blend well with the surroundings of field and wood. It is a good idea to sit silently for a time on some log or stump, and soon the birds will come about you, for they seldom notice a person who is motionless. A great aid to field study is a good Field\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"Their breeding grounds were chiefly on the islands and along the shores of Labrador, as well as on the islands and mainland about the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Any one over forty years of age will remember how very popular feather beds used to be. In fact, there are those of us who know from experience that in many rural sections the deep feather bed is still regarded as the pi\\u00e8ce de {131} resistance of the careful householder's equipment. There was a time when the domestic poultry of New England did not furnish as great a supply of feathers as\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the birds and game belong to the people of the state? Therefore what had the Government to do with the subject? Furthermore, were there not numerous court decisions upholding the authority of the states in their declarations of ownership of the birds and game? Others saw in this move only another attempt toward increasing the power of the central government, and depriving the states further of their inalienable rights. This remarkable document was discussed to some extent but nothing was done. Four years later {179} Congressman John W. Weeks reintroduced the bill with slight modifications. Nothing came of this any\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"life that is to be found in a country of farmlands, interspersed with thickets and groves. Originally extensive regions of eastern North America were covered with forests wherein birds that thrive in open countries could not find suitable habitation. As soon as the trees were cut the face of the country began to assume an aspect which greatly favoured such species as the Bobolink, Meadowlark, Quail, Vesper Sparrow, and others of the field-loving varieties. The open country brought them suitable places to nest, and agriculture increased their food supply. The settlers began killing off the wolves, wild cats, skunks, opossums,\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"or have been injured by striking telephone or telegraph wires, an accident which often happens. Once I picked up a Loon after a stormy night. Apparently it had recovered its strength after a few hours' rest, but, as this bird can rise on the wing only from a body of water, over the surface of which it can paddle and flap for many rods, and as {78} there was no pond or lake in all the neighbouring country, the Loon's fate was evident from the first. Birds are often swept to sea by storm winds from off shore. Vainly they\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"said to put to death the incompetent and unfit, so do the laws operate which govern wild life. If, therefore, we should destroy all the Hawks, Owls, wild cats, foxes, skunks, {118} snakes, and other predatory creatures, it is an open question whether in the long run our game birds would be the gainers thereby. Some time ago I visited a large game farm in one of the Southern States, where for several years the owner had been engaged in raising English Ring-necked Pheasants. The gamekeeper stated that there were about six thousand of these brilliantly coloured birds on the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"nineteen Scaups in addition to many others such as Redheads and Golden-eyes. His survey was not exhaustive and the Gulls had doubtless removed many bodies from the territory {93} he visited. When the surface of lakes and bays freezes suddenly in the night Ducks are sometimes caught and held fast by the ice adhering to their feathers and legs. In this condition they are utterly unable to escape the attacks of man and beast, and in the latitude of New York captures in this way are now and then reported.

Cotton and feathers enter largely into the composition of the lining of a Shrike's nest. In Florida the Mockingbird shows a decided preference for the withered leaves and stems of life-everlasting, better known as the plant that produces \\\"rabbit tobacco.\\\" The nest of the Summer Tanager is made almost entirely of grasses, the outer half being green, freshly plucked blades that contrast strikingly with the {29} brown inner layer with which the nest is lined. Many of the Thrushes make use of large flat leaves, and also of rags and pieces of paper. Robins stiffen their\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"can understand more fully why our legislative bodies have regarded so seriously the subject of bird protection. In one of the Year Books of the Department we read that the annual loss to the cotton crop of the United States by insects amounts to sixty million dollars. We learn, too, that grasshoppers and other insects annually destroy fifty-three million dollars' worth of hay and that two million dollars' worth of cereals are each year eaten by our insect population. In fact, we are told that one-tenth of all the cereals, hay, cotton, tobacco, forests, and general farm products is the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"a time when the domestic poultry of New England did not furnish as great a supply of feathers as was desired.

These adventurous bird pirates secured their booty either by killing the birds or taking the down from the nests. The commercializing of the Labrador Duck meant its\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"this one may get a good idea of the birds to be found in various communities at this season.

The first movement in this new direction was made by Elihu Root on January 14, 1913, when he introduced in the Senate a resolution requesting the President to propose to the other governments the negotiation of a convention for the protection of birds.

The Cowbird lays its eggs in the nests of various other birds, distributing them about the neighbourhood.

The conduct of these decoys indicates that the losing of a mate is a much more serious matter among them than with the Bluebird and others of our small feathered friends.

If one is killed, many years may elapse before the survivor selects another companion.

When finding the nests I had made the mistake of going to within a few inches of them. Had I stopped six feet away the despoiler that followed probably never would have known there was a nest near, for unless a dog approaches within a very few feet of a brooding Quail it seems not to possess the power of smelling it.

Game Law Enforcement.\\u2014In all the States but Florida there are special State officers charged with enforcing the bird and game protective laws. Usually there is a Game Commission of three or more members whose duty it is to select an executive officer who in turn appoints game wardens throughout the State.

The dooryards have become little bird reservations. I have several {215} friends who regularly feed Chickadees in winter, perched on their outstretched hands. It is astonishing how quickly wild creatures respond to a reasonable treatment. This may readily be learned by any householder who will try the experiment. With a little patience any teacher can instruct her pupils in the simple art of making the birds feel at home in the vicinity of\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"themselves in your skin, while a cloud of mosquitoes waves behind you like a veil. In the sombre shadows through which you move you have a feeling that there are many unseen things that crawl and glide and fly, and a creepy feeling about the edges of your scalp becomes a familiar sensation.

By failing to observe these simple rules the learner may be in despair when he tries to find out the name of his strange bird by examining a bird book, or may cause some kindly friend an equal amount of annoyance. As a further aid to subsequent identification it is well to record the place where the bird was seen, for example: \\\"hopping up the side of\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"weeks they will collect a chattering multitude in the trees of some lawn, or in those skirting a village street, and there at times cause great annoyance to their human neighbours. Across the Hudson River from New York, in the Hackensack marshes, behind the Palisades, clouds of Swallows collect in the late summer evenings, and for many days one may see them from the car windows as they glide through the upper air or swarm to roost among the rushes.

Natural Nesting Places Destroyed.\\u2014Some kinds of birds, as far back as we know their history, have built their nests in the holes of trees. Woodpeckers have strong, chisel-shaped bills and are able to excavate nesting cavities, but there are others that do not possess such tools. These must depend on finding the abandoned hole of some Woodpecker, or the natural hollow of some tree. It not infrequently happens that such birds are obliged to search far and wide for a hole in which\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"will let you stroke its back before deserting its eggs, and may even let you take its photograph while you are thus engaged.

Lessons to Be Learned.\\u2014An infinite variety of interesting things may be learned by watching birds at their nests, or by a study of the nests themselves. How many\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"most usual number. Wild Ducks, Turkeys, and Grouse range from eight to a dozen or more; while Quails sometimes lay as many as eighteen. Eggs are variously coloured, and some are so marked that the blending of their colours with those of their surroundings renders them inconspicuous. Thus those of the Killdeer, Sandpiper, and Nighthawk, for example, are not easily distinguished from the ground on which they lie. Many eggs that are laid in holes or other dark places are white without markings of any kind, as illustrated by those of the Chimney Swift, Belted Kingfisher, and all Woodpeckers. In\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"required age to form a circle, and the distances between them are so great that frequent meetings cannot be held, but good work is being done. \\\"The most interesting feature of our work the past year was the collection of abandoned birds' nests in the autumn. One school of five pupils collected over 100 nests. From these collections two selections of ten nests each were made, to be sent to New York City. One collection went to the Jacob Riis Settlement, and one passed through the hands of three kindergartens, interesting 100 children. To each nest was attached a coloured\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"constant resident in groves of deciduous trees. It feeds, among other things, on borers living in the bark of trees, on plant lice which suck the sap, on caterpillars which consume the leaves, and on codling worms which destroy fruit. One naturalist found that four Chickadees had eaten one hundred and five female cankerworm moths. With scalpel, tweezers, and microscope these moths were examined, {106} and each was found to contain on an average one hundred and eighty-five eggs. This gives a total of nearly twenty thousand cankerworm moth eggs destroyed by four birds in a few minutes. The Chickadee\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"states working separately. Many of us believe this predicts a brighter day for the perpetuation of the wild life of our country. The creation of reservations where wild birds can be protected at all times is a modern idea, brought prominently to public attention by the efforts of the Audubon Society. The first interest that the United States Government manifested in the subject was about thirteen years ago. On May 29, 1901, the legislature of Florida was induced to enact a statute making it a misdemeanour to kill any non-game birds of the State with the exception of the Crow\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"apparently because such birds are seldom marked in such a way as to enable one to be positive that they are the identical individuals which came the year before. It is probably somewhere near the truth to say that most small birds usually choose the same mates year after year if both survive the dangers of winter and in spring meet again on their old trysting grounds. It is safe to assert that as a rule birds retain the same mates throughout the breeding season if misfortune does not befall one of them.

Such fruits in most places are easily grown, and they make a pleasant addition to the birds' menu. In a well-watered territory {236} birds are always more numerous than in a dry region. You may find a hundred of them along the stream in the valley to one on the mountain-top. A cemetery undecorated with fountains, and through or near which no stream flows, is too dry a place for the average bird to risk the exigencies of rearing a family. A few simply constructed fountains or drinking-pools will work wonders\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"cement and the birds are literally left out in the cold. It is plainly to be seen, therefore, that one reason why more birds do not remain in our towns through the spring months is the absence of places where they can lay their eggs and rear their young. Nesting Boxes for Birds.\\u2014To overcome this difficulty the Audubon Society several years ago began to advocate the erection of suitable nesting boxes, and to-day the practice is gaining wide usage. More persons every year are putting such boxes upon poles {218} or nailing them to trees about their homes, and some\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"birdbaths, houses to be put up of all sorts, from Wren boxes, Von Berlepsch model.

Birds seem rarely to lose their sense of direction, and they pursue their way for hundreds of miles across the trackless ocean. Terns, Gulls, and Murres are known to go many miles in quest of food for their young and return through dense fogs with unerring directness to their nests. During the spring it is not uncommon for strange waterfowl to be found helpless in the streets or fields of a region in which they are ordinarily unknown. These birds have become exhausted during the storm of the night before, or have\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"yet enacted in the United States is the one known as the Federal Migratory Game Law or the McLean Law. A somewhat {172} extended discussion of this important measure seems justifiable at this time. When, in 1913, the first breath of autumn swept over the tule sloughs and reedy lakes of the North-west, the wild fowl and shore birds of that vast region rose in clouds, and by stages began to journey toward {173} their winter quarters beneath Southern skies. If the older birds that had often taken the same trip thought anything about the subject, they must have been\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"thirty-one feet above the earth. By means of climbing-irons and a rope that passed around the tree and around my body, I slowly ascended, nailing cleats for support as I advanced. After two hours of toil the nest was reached, but another twenty minutes were required to tear aside enough of the structure to permit climbing up one of the limbs on which it rested. In doing this there were brought to view several layers of decayed twigs, pine straw, and fish bones, showing that the birds had been using the nest for many years. Season after season the huge\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"belong to the people of the state? Therefore what had the Government to do with the subject? Furthermore, were there not numerous court decisions upholding the authority of the states in their declarations of ownership of the birds and game? Others saw in this move only another attempt toward increasing the power of the central government, and depriving the states further of their inalienable rights. This remarkable document was discussed to some extent but nothing was done. Four years later {179} Congressman John W. Weeks reintroduced the bill with slight modifications.

Feeding Birds.\\u2014Much can be done to bring birds about the home or the schoolhouse by placing food where they can readily get it. The majority of land birds that pass the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"scarcely moved. During this time the lives of thirty-two specimens of animal life had been blotted out. The perpetrator of this holocaust was a creature known to scientists as Spizella socialis\\u2014called by ordinary people Chipping Sparrow. Its victims were small insects which but a moment before were disporting themselves on the grass. Preparation of Teachers.\\u2014One teacher expressed {240} surprise that a bird could find so many of these choice morsels in so short a time.

History of Game Laws.\\u2014When the United States of America became a free and independent nation the lawmakers in various commonwealths soon addressed themselves to the task of enacting protective measures for insuring the continuance of the supply of desirable game birds and animals. But as the years went by, and the game showed every indication of continuing to decrease despite the measures that had been adopted for their benefit, other and more stringent game laws were enacted. In the fullness of time there came into being in every state\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"dog approaches within a very few feet of a brooding Quail it seems not to possess the power of smelling it.

Often one may get good views of birds from one's open window, as many species build their nests close to the house when the surroundings are favourable.

Ants, besides being wood borers, invaders of pantries, killers of young birds, nuisances to campers and barefoot {109} boys, care for and perpetuate plant lice which infest vegetation in all parts of the country to our very serious loss. Professor Forbes, in his study of the corn plant louse, found that in spring ants mine along the principal roots of the corn. Then they collect the plant lice, or aphids, and convey them into these burrows and there watch and protect them. Without the assistance of ants, it appears that the plant lice would be unable to reach the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"of the most pleasing sights I {60} have witnessed was a male Gnatcatcher that had relieved his mate at the nest. He was sitting on the eggs and, with head thrown back, sang with all his might, apparently unconscious of the evil which such gaiety might bring upon his household.

So far as there is any record, young Ostriches were first captured and enclosed with a view of rearing them for profit in the year 1857. This occurred in South Africa. During the years which have since elapsed, the raising of Ostriches and the exportation of their plumes has become one of the chief business enterprises of South Africa. Very naturally people in other parts of the world wished to engage in a {164} similar enterprise when they saw with what success the undertaking\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the eastern Song Sparrow.

Woodpeckers have strong, chisel-shaped bills and are able to excavate nesting cavities, but there are others that do not possess such tools.

It not infrequently happens that such birds are\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"danger of rolling away to destruction. On the sandy islands of the Atlantic Coast, from Long Island southward, many species of Terns make nests by simply burrowing a slight depression in the sand among the sea-shells. Some of the sea birds of the far North, as, for example, the Murres and Auks, often lay their eggs on the shelving cliffs exposed to the sweep of the ocean gales. These are shaped as if designed by nature to prevent them rolling off the rocks. They are very large at one {41} end and toward the other taper sharply.

Diminution of Other Species.\\u2014Of the fifty-five kinds of Wild Ducks, Geese, and Swans commonly found in North America, there is probably not one as numerous to-day as it was a hundred or even fifty years ago. Why? The markets where their bodies commanded a price of so much per head have swallowed them up. The shotgun has also played havoc with the Prairie Chicken and the Sage Grouse. Of the former possibly as many as one thousand exist on the Heath Hen Reservation of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, a pitiful remnant of the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"upholding the authority of the states in their declarations of ownership of the birds and game? Others saw in this move only another attempt toward increasing the power of the central government, and depriving the states further of their inalienable rights. This remarkable document was discussed to some extent but nothing was done. Four years later {179} Congressman John W. Weeks reintroduced the bill with slight modifications. Nothing came of this any more than of the bill that he started going in 1909. In 1911 he again brought forward this pet measure toward which Congress had so often turned a\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"important nursery for Gulls, Terns, Ducks, and Cormorants in summer, and a safe harbour for wild fowl during the spring and fall migrations. Huron Island and Siskiwit in Lake Superior, the homes of innumerable Herring Gulls, were made perpetual bird sanctuaries, and Audubon wardens took up their lonely watch to guard them against all comers. Florida Reservations.\\u2014At the mouth of Tampa Bay, Florida, is a ninety-acre island, Passage Key. Here the wild bird life of the Gulf Coast has swarmed in the mating season since white man first knew the {195} country. Thousands of Herons of various species, as well\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the Black, and Waccamaw rivers were frozen solid, and the Woodcock, that in winter abound in this region, were thus driven to the softer grounds farther downstream. The cold continued and the frozen area followed the birds. The Woodcock, unable to drive their long bills into the once-responsive mud, were forced to continue their flight toward the coast in search of open ground where worms could be found. When at length they reached Winyaw Bay, where these rivers converge, they were at the point of exhaustion. Thousands of the emaciated birds swarmed in the streets and gardens of Georgetown. They\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"soon become water-soaked and drowning would result. Multitudes of small birds, including even the little Ruby-throated Hummingbird, annually cross the Gulf of Mexico at a single flight. This necessitates a continuous journey of from five hundred to seven hundred miles. Some North American birds migrate southward only a few hundred miles to pass the winter, while many others go from Canada and the United States to Mexico, Central and South America. The ponds and sloughs of all that vast country lying between the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay on the east and the mountains of the Far West, constitute the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"weaving its swinging cradle on an elm limb to go into a box nailed to the side of the tree. Feeding Birds.\\u2014Much can be done to bring birds about the home or the schoolhouse by placing food where they can readily get it. The majority of land birds that pass the winter in Canada or in the colder parts of the United States feed mainly upon seeds. Cracked corn, wheat, rice, sunflower seed, hemp seed, and bird seed, purchased readily in any town, are, therefore, exceedingly attractive articles of diet. Bread crumbs are enjoyed by many species. Food should not\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"some convenient club or rock. After a little treatment of this kind the bird will often come to the entrance and look down, as if to inquire into the meaning of all the disturbance. If the nest has been newly made many fragments of small chips of wood will be found on the ground beneath the tree. Variety of Situations.\\u2014The student who takes up {37} the subject of nest architecture will soon be impressed not only with the wide assortment of materials used, but also with the wonderful variety of situations chosen. The Grebe, or \\\"Water Witch,\\\" builds one of\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"to make an island of a place where the Redwings nest. \\\"Trails to be cut through the brush and the turf grass in a charming bit of old orchard on the hilltop, to be restored for the benefit of worm-pulling Robins. \\\"Several stone basins to be constructed for birdbaths, houses to be put up of all sorts, from Wren boxes, Von Berlepsch model.

One reservation in Alaska covers much of the lower delta of the Yukon, including the great tundra country south of the river, embracing within its borders a territory greater than the {198} State of Connecticut. From the standpoint of preserving rare species of birds this is doubtless one of the most\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"ocean herring and salmon return to {62} the streams of their nativity when the spirit of migration sweeps over the shoals into the abysmal depths. There are butterflies that in companies rise from mud puddles beside the road and go dancing away to the South in autumn. The caribou, in long streams, come southward over the barrens of Labrador when the word is passed, and even squirrels, over extended regions, have been known to migrate en masse for hundreds of miles. There is, however, no phase of the life of birds which is quite so distinctive. The extent and duration\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"a cloud of mosquitoes waves behind you like a veil. In the sombre shadows through which you move you have a feeling that there are many unseen things that crawl and glide and fly, and a creepy feeling about the edges of your scalp becomes a familiar sensation. Once we came upon the trail of a bear and found the going easier when we waded on hands and knees through the opening its body had made. In the more open places the water was completely {207} covered with floating plants that Greene called \\\"wild lettuce.\\\" These appeared to be uniform\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"nature teaching which took him from his ordinarily uninteresting studies into the wide out of doors. Thousands of teachers have written letters filled with expressions of thankfulness for this opportunity which has come to them and reciting details of the variety of ways in which they have been able to make use of this plan and material for bird study. What One Teacher Did.\\u2014Here, for example, is one from Miss Beth Merritt, who teaches in a little school at Fountain City, Tennessee: \\\"I am very glad to {248} write to you about the Junior Audubon Class we had at school\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"while guarding a Florida bird rookery. In the heat of campaigns she has worked overtime and on holidays. I have never known a woman who laboured more conscientiously or was apparently more interested in the work. Frequently her eyes would open wide and she would express resentment when reports reached the office of the atrocities perpetrated on wild birds by the heartless agents of the feather trade. Recently she married and left us. Last week she called at the office, looking very beautiful and radiant. After a few moments' conversation she approached the subject which {162} evidently lay close to\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the eastern and the other those of the western part of the United States. The pictures alone will be of great use in learning the names of feathered neighbours, while an intelligent study of the text will reveal the identity of many others. Local lists of such birds as are found in a neighbourhood, or a county, are always a great aid in determining, with a fair degree of accuracy, just what species may or may not be expected to appear in a given locality. Such lists are usually first published in The Auk, The Condor, or other ornithological publications,\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"schoolroom. Study them and learn that the Chipping Sparrow's nest is made of fine rootlets and grasses, and is lined with horsehair; {256} examine the mud cup of the Robin's nest, the soft lining of the Loggerhead Shrike's nest, etc. Feeding Birds.\\u2014In winter arrange \\\"bird tables\\\" in the trees and by the windows, and place crumbs and seeds on them; in summer put out bathing and drinking pans, note what birds come to them and how frequently, and report what you observe to the class. Nesting Boxes.\\u2014In early spring put up nesting boxes for Bluebirds, Wrens, Chickadees, Nuthatches, Martins, and\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"and the young to be reared by the foster parents. Cowbird's eggs have been found in the nests of nearly one hundred species of birds, and nearly always the nest of some smaller bird is chosen. Despite this fact the Cowbird's eggs are often first to hatch. The young grow rapidly and, being strong and aggressive, not only secure the lion's share of the food, but frequently crowd the young of the rightful owner out of the nest to perish on the ground beneath. As soon as the young leave the nest the greedy Cowbird follows the little mother about\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"prohibitory statutes. Legislators are not usually supposed to spend much energy on drafting and enacting measures unless it is thought that these will result in practical benefit to at least some portion of their constituents. Legislative bodies are not much given to appropriating hundreds of thousands of dollars annually for the enforcement of a law which is purely sentimental in its nature. It is clear, therefore, that our law makers regard the wild bird life as {102} a great value to the country from the standpoint of dollars and cents. Destructiveness of Insects.\\u2014If we go back a few years and\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"Nebraska, Kansas, and New Mexico, constituting the group of states whose legislatures had thus far withstood the importunities of the Audubon workers to extend protection to such birds. Regulation Number Four provided for an absolute closed hunting season on sixty-two species of water birds until September, 1918. The above includes what we might call some of the minor regulations proposed by the Biological Survey Committee. Then comes the big regulation, the one which was of absorbing interest to every member of the vast army of five million hunters in the United States. This is the regulation which divides the country\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"contest. In this novel undertaking even the women of the class displayed great zeal. When time was called it was found that one student had a credit of fourteen, another sixteen, a third nineteen, and one tall young woman with glasses exhibited twenty-one insects in the folds of her handkerchief. A stranger watching the actions of this band of eager, early-rising teachers might have been puzzled to determine what induced them to assemble at this hour of the day for the evident purpose of watching the habits and activities of small birds that the ordinary person passes without notice. They\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the country into zones and prescribes the shooting seasons in each. Touching on this point the Government experts already mentioned gave out this statement by way of explanation: Government Explanations.\\u2014\\\"More than fifty separate seasons for migratory birds were provided under statutes in force in 1912. This multiplicity of regulations of zones to suit special localities has apparently had anything but a beneficial effect on the abundance of game. The effort to provide special seasons for each kind of game in each locality merely makes a chain of open seasons for migratory birds and allows the continued destruction of such birds\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the country from evil influences, and to direct their curiosity and restless energy into safe and productive channels. The teacher occupies a strategic position in this matter, and one of her problems is how to {244} engage the interest of the child in subjects that are both entertaining and beneficial. Simple lessons in nature study are an excellent method by which to accomplish this end, and a study of out-of-door life should begin with birds. Bird Study Class.\\u2014The systematic instruction of school children in bird study on a careful scientific basis in a large way really had its origin in\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"makes the following offer of assistance to those teachers and others who are interested in giving instruction to children on the subject of birds and their usefulness. To form a Junior Audubon Class for bird study, a teacher should explain to the pupils of her grade (and others if desired) that their object will be to learn all they can about the wild birds, and that every one who becomes a member will be expected to be kind to the birds and protect them. Every member will be required to pay a fee of ten cents each year. When ten\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"Societies, with headquarters at 1974 Broadway, New York City, makes the following offer of assistance to those teachers and others who are interested in giving instruction to children on the subject of birds and their usefulness. To form a Junior Audubon Class for bird study, a teacher should explain to the pupils of her grade (and others if desired) that their object will be to learn all they can about the wild birds, and that every one who becomes a member will be expected to be kind to the birds and protect them. Every member will be required to pay\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"season. That year President Roosevelt established four more bird refuges. One of these, Stump Lake, in North Dakota, became an important nursery for Gulls, Terns, Ducks, and Cormorants in summer, and a safe harbour for wild fowl during the spring and fall migrations. Huron Island and Siskiwit in Lake Superior, the homes of innumerable Herring Gulls, were made perpetual bird sanctuaries, and Audubon wardens took up their lonely watch to guard them against all comers. Florida Reservations.\\u2014At the mouth of Tampa Bay, Florida, is a ninety-acre island, Passage Key. Here the wild bird life of the Gulf Coast has swarmed\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"of their parents what is desirable. Soon they are able to shift for themselves, although one or both of the parents continue to attend them until grown. With the altricial birds the young are hatched in an absolutely helpless condition, being both blind and naked, and it is necessary that they be fed by the parents, not only while occupying the nest, but also for several weeks afterward. To this group belong most of the small birds we are accustomed to see about the house. When newly born the food they receive is first digested in the crop or the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"give at least one lesson a month on the subject of birds, for which purpose she will find the leaflets of great value as a basis for the lessons. Rules for a Bird Study Class.\\u2014If the teacher wishes, the Audubon Class may have a regular organization, and a pupil may preside upon the occasions when the class is discussing a lesson. For this purpose the following simple constitution is suggested: Article 1. The organization shall be known as the (give name) Junior Audubon Class. Article 2. The object of its members shall be to learn all they can about wild\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"and children, but the story of the aigrette trade deals with the slaughter of innocents by the slow process of {153} starvation, a method which history shows has never been followed by even the most savage race of men dealing with their most hated enemies. This war of extermination which was carried forward unchecked for years could mean but one thing, namely, the rapid disappearance of the Egrets in the United States. As nesting birds, they have disappeared from New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia, and also those States of the central Mississippi Valley where they were at one time to\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"believe that Eagles were ferocious birds when their nests were approached, it was with feelings of relief that I noticed the parents flying about at long rifle-range. The female, which, as is usual with birds of prey, was the larger of the pair, once or twice swept within twenty yards of my head, but quickly veered off and resumed her former action of beating back and forth over the tree-tops two hundred yards away. Nests in Holes.\\u2014The members of the Woodpecker family, contrary to certain popular beliefs, do not lay their eggs in hollow trees but deposit them in cavities\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the Sea Swallows.\\u2014During a period of seven years more than 500,000 Terns', or Sea Swallows', skins were collected in spring and summer in the sounds of North and South Carolina. These figures I compiled from the records and accounts given me by men who did the killing. Their method was to fit out small sailing vessels on which they could live comfortably and cruise for several weeks; in fact, they were usually out during the entire three months of the nesting period. That was the time of year that offered best rewards for such work, for then the birds' {142}\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"sea birds journey hither when the instinct for mating is strong upon them. Here come \\\"Love Birds\\\" or White Terns, and Albatrosses, great winged wonders whose home is on the rolling deep. The number seems almost beyond belief to men and women unfamiliar with bird life in congested colonies. On February 3, 1909, these islands and reefs were included in an executive order whereby {199} the \\\"Hawaiian Island Reservation\\\" was brought into existence. This is the largest of all our Government bird reserves. It extends through more than five degrees of longitude. At intervals in the past these islands had\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the thickets, shouting loudly for food. Its fierce clamour drowns the weaker cries of the legitimate young, which I have reason to believe even then often die for lack {58} of nourishment. So insistent is the young Cowbird and so persistently does it pursue the foster parent that it is well cared for and invariably thrives. It is no uncommon sight, during the days of June and July, to see a worn, bedraggled Song Sparrow {59} working desperately in a frantic effort to feed one or more great hulking Cowbirds twice its size. It is little wonder that discerning people\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"degrees to 33 degrees; walked about 10 miles.

Huron Island and Siskiwit in Lake Superior, the homes of innumerable Herring Gulls, were made perpetual bird sanctuaries, and Audubon wardens took up their lonely watch to guard them against all comers. Florida Reservations.\\u2014At the mouth of Tampa Bay, Florida, is a ninety-acre island, Passage Key. Here the wild bird life of the Gulf Coast has swarmed in the mating season since white man first knew the {195} country. Thousands of Herons of various species, as well as Terns and shore birds, make this their home. Dainty little Ground Doves flutter in and out among the cactus on\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"on cold nights, who if undisturbed will often return again and again to the refuge it has once found safe and comfortable. Birds that pass the winter in the Northern States are subjected to many hardships. In fact, the fatalities in the bird world in winter are so great, and the population so constantly reduced by one form of tragedy or another, that it is only the stronger and more fortunate individuals of a species that survive to enjoy the summer. The Food Question in Winter.\\u2014Where to secure the food is the big question which confronts every bird when it\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"rifle battles that they have had with poachers, and written letters to the widow of one of our agents shot to death while guarding a Florida bird rookery. In the heat of campaigns she has worked overtime and on holidays. I have never known a woman who laboured more conscientiously or was apparently more interested in the work. Frequently her eyes would open wide and she would express resentment when reports reached the office of the atrocities perpetrated on wild birds by the heartless agents of the feather trade. Recently she married and left us. Last week she called at\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"dense fogs with unerring directness to their nests. During the spring it is not uncommon for strange waterfowl to be found helpless in the streets or fields of a region in which they are ordinarily unknown. These birds have become exhausted during the storm of the night before, or have been injured by striking telephone or telegraph wires, an accident which often happens. Once I picked up a Loon after a stormy night. Apparently it had recovered its strength after a few hours' rest, but, as this bird can rise on the wing only from a body of water, over\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"upon brittle twigs, and crashing through the underbrush. Go quietly, stopping to listen every few steps. Make no violent motions, as such actions often frighten a bird more than a noise. Do not wear brightly coloured clothing, but garments of neutral tones which blend well with the surroundings of field and wood. It is a good idea to sit silently for a time on some log or stump, and soon the birds will come about you, for they seldom notice a person who is motionless. A great aid to field study is a good Field Glass. A glass enables one\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the greatest aid to the beginner in bird study. Among the most useful are the Reed's, \\\"Bird Guides,\\\" one covering the birds of the eastern and the other those of the western part of the United States. The pictures alone will be of great use in learning the names of feathered neighbours, while an intelligent study of the text will reveal the identity of many others. Local lists of such birds as are found in a neighbourhood, or a county, are always a great aid in determining, with a fair degree of accuracy, just what species may or may not\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"from the Flinthead's heavy beak! There were probably one hundred thousand of these birds inhabiting Corkscrew Rookery at the time of my visit. There were also large colonies of the smaller White Ibis and several varieties of Heron. Eight of the almost extinct Roseate Spoonbills wheeled into view above the swamp, but quickly passed from sight. The most interesting birds, those concerning which the Audubon Society is most solicitous, are the White Egrets. These snow-white models of grace and beauty have been persecuted for their plumes almost to the point of extermination, and here is situated the largest assemblage of\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"of the birds, and thus quickly learn to recognize them in the field. Many teachers have utilized this as an exercise for the regular drawing hour. Teaching Children Approved by the Government.\\u2014Considering the importance of the subject and the success that the plan has met, it is little wonder that the Hon. P. P. Claxton, United States Commissioner of Education, early gave it his unqualified endorsement. In one letter he wrote: \\\"I consider the work of the Junior Audubon {258} Classes very important for both educational and economic results, and I congratulate you upon the opportunity of extending it. The\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"hand, the Mockingbird, Robin, or Shrike, will raise a great outcry and bring about her half the birds of the neighbourhood to pour out on you their vials of wrath, unless you have the good judgment to retire at once to a respectful distance. Warblers will flit from bush to bush uttering cries of distress and showing their uneasiness. The Mourning Dove, Nighthawk, and many others will feign lameness and seek to lead you away in a vain pursuit. A still larger number will employ the same means of deception after the young have been hatched, as, for example, the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"such seekers after truth by the simple means of pointing out some of the interesting things that may be sought and readily found in the field and by the open road. In the preparation of this volume much valuable aid has been received from Messrs. E. W. Nelson, F. E. L. Beal, Wells W. Cooke, T. S. Palmer, H. C. Oberholser, and others of the United States Biological Survey, for which the author desires to make grateful acknowledgment. Parts of some of the chapters have previously appeared in the \\\"Craftsman Magazine\\\" and \\\"Country Life in America,\\\" and are here reproduced\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"as a rule, but sometimes make use of a living tree by digging the nest out of the dead wood where a knot hole offers a convenient opening. The only place I have ever known them regularly to nest in living trees is in the deserts of Arizona, where the saguaro or \\\"tree cactus\\\" is about the only tree large enough to be employed for such a purpose. In the {35} Northern States Flickers sometimes chisel holes through the weatherboarding of ice-houses and make cavities for their eggs in the tightly packed sawdust within. They have been known also to\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"for these attentions the ants feast upon the honey-like substances secreted by these aphids. The ants, which have the reputation of being no sluggards, take good care of their diminutive milch cattle, and will tenderly pick them up and transport them to new pastures when the old ones fail. Late in the summer they carefully collect all the aphid eggs that are obtainable, and taking them into their nests keep them safe during the winter. When spring comes and the eggs hatch, the ants gather the young plant lice and place them on plants. It may be seen, therefore, that\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"old women of moderate incomes, who sacrifice much for this millinery luxury. There were at that time to be found in Florida many hundreds of colonies of these beautiful birds, but their feathers commanded a large price and offered a most tempting inducement for local hunters to shoot them. Many of the men of the region were poor, and the rich harvest which awaited them was very inviting. At that time gunners received from seventy-five cents to one dollar and a quarter for the \\\"scalp\\\" of each bird, which ordinarily contained forty or more plume feathers. These birds were not\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"eyes on the first snowy morning of winter. Not only has the whole aspect of the country been changed, but the old sources of food have passed away. Not a caterpillar is to be found on the dead leaves, and not a winged insect is left to come flying {87} by; hence other food must be looked for in new directions. Emboldened by hunger, the Starlings alight at the kitchen door, and the Juncos, Sparrows, Downy Woodpeckers, and Nuthatches come to feed on the window-sill. Jays and Meadowlarks haunt the manure piles or haystacks in search of fragments of grain.\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"resulting thick mass of leaves and twigs offered so fine a place for concealing nests that few birds could resist the temptation to use them. Other means of rendering a cemetery alluring to nesting birds will readily present themselves when an active interest is developed in the subject. A little thought, a little care, and a little trouble, would make it possible for many birds to dwell in a cemetery, and it must be remembered that unless they can nest there, the chances are that no great volume of bird music will fill the air. The young of most song\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"game birds should be stopped everywhere. But the legislatures of many states paid small heed to the little minority of their constituents who voiced such sentiments, and the problem of how to bring about the desired results remained unsolved. The Theory of Shiras.\\u2014In the year 1904 a United States Congressman announced to the country that he had found the proper solution for settling once and for all the question of spring shooting, and for putting to an end the ceaseless wrangling that {178} continually went on in the various legislatures when the subject was brought up. This gentleman, George Shiras,\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"while one afternoon seven hundred hats were counted and on them but twenty birds recognized, five hundred and forty-two were decorated with feathers of some kind. Of the one hundred and fifty-eight remaining, seventy-two were worn by young or middle-aged ladies, and eighty-six by ladies in mourning or elderly ladies.\\\" This was a period when people seemed to go mad on the subject of wearing birds and feathers. They were used for feminine adornment in almost every conceivable fashion. Here are two quotations from New York daily papers of that time, only the names {148} of the ladies are changed:\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"of the destructive white race. Away out in the western group of the Hawaiian Archipelago are located some of the world's most famous colonies of birds. From remote regions of the Pacific sea birds journey hither when the instinct for mating is strong upon them. Here come \\\"Love Birds\\\" or White Terns, and Albatrosses, great winged wonders whose home is on the rolling deep. The number seems almost beyond belief to men and women unfamiliar with bird life in congested colonies. On February 3, 1909, these islands and reefs were included in an executive order whereby {199} the \\\"Hawaiian Island\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"as Warblers and Vireos, do not possess a strong flocking instinct, but, nevertheless, they may be seen associated in numbers during the season of the northern and southern movements. Such birds migrate chiefly at night and have been observed through telescopes at high altitudes. Such observations are made by pointing the telescope at the disk of the full moon on clear nights. On cloudy or foggy nights the birds fly lower, as may be known by the clearer sounds of their calls as they pass over; at times one may even hear the flutter of their wings. There is a\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the swamp is drained it means that the otter, the mink, and the Wild Duck must go, but the meadowland that takes the place of the swamp {127} provides for an increased number of other species of wild life. Effect of Forest Devastation.\\u2014Only in a comparatively few cases has bird life suffered from the destruction of forests. In parts of the Middle West the Woodpeckers have no doubt decreased in {128} numbers. There are places where one may travel for many miles without seeing a single grove in which these birds could live. Passenger Pigeons as late as 1870 were\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"may be in despair when he tries to find out the name of his strange bird by examining a bird book, or may cause some kindly friend an equal amount of annoyance. As a further aid to subsequent identification it is well to record the place where the bird was seen, for example: \\\"hopping up the side of a tree,\\\" \\\"wading in a marsh,\\\" \\\"circling about in the air,\\\" or \\\"feeding {12} on dandelions.\\\" Such secondary information, while often a valuable aid to identification, would in itself hardly be sufficient to enable an ornithologist to render the service desired.

The number seems almost beyond belief to men and women unfamiliar with bird life in congested colonies. On February\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"tree, or hops along its bark, one is quick to recognize the Woodpecker manner when some other species of that family is encountered. Recalling the ceaseless activities of a Yellow Warbler the observer feels, without quite knowing why, that he has discovered another Warbler of some kind when a Redstart or Chestnut-sided Warbler appears. Once identify a Barn Swallow coursing through the air, and a long {16} stride is made toward the identification of the Cliff or Tree Swallow when one swings into view. The flight of the Flicker, the Goldfinch, the Nighthawk, and the Sparrow Hawk, is so characteristic\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"too near, and invariably one or both old birds will let him know of their presence by voicing their resentment and sending abroad their cries of distress. Character of Material Used.\\u2014A wide variety of material is used by birds that build open nests. Cotton and feathers enter largely into the composition of the lining of a Shrike's nest. In Florida the Mockingbird shows a decided preference for the withered leaves and stems of life-everlasting, better known as the plant that produces \\\"rabbit tobacco.\\\" The nest of the Summer Tanager is made almost entirely of grasses, the outer half being green,\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the lake. One of the best-known polygamous birds of North America is the Wild Turkey. Go into any part of the country where this fast-disappearing game bird still survives, and the experienced local gunners will tell you that in the mating season you will usually find a gobbler accompanied by two or more Turkey hens. When a female gets ready to make her nest she slips away from her sultan and the other members {56} of the seraglio and, going to some broom-sedge field or open place in the woods, constructs her nest on the ground beneath some slight, convenient\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"Imagine the chagrin of the Audubon workers upon learning from their warden that when the Pelicans returned that season to occupy the island as before, they took one look at this declaration of the President and immediately departed, one and all, to a neighbouring island entirely outside of the reservation! Signs less alarming in size were substituted, and the Pelicans, their feelings appeased, condescended to return, and have since dwelt peacefully under the protecting care of the Government. Congressional Sanction.\\u2014In view of the fact that some persons contended that the President had over-stepped his authority in making a bird reservation,\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the rocks by men who wrought in the dawn of history. We wonder at the compelling force that drove our ancestors through the forests of northern Germany, or caused the Aztecs to cross the Mexican deserts. It calls to something in our blood, for even the most stolid must at times hearken to the Pied Piper and with Kipling feel that \\\"On the other side the world we're overdue.\\\" Man is not alone the possessor of the migrating passion.

When the case came up in the Federal Court of Eastern Arkansas, the judge who presided declared that the federal law under which the defendant was being tried was unconstitutional, and wrote a lengthy decision, giving his reasons for holding this view. Within the next two months two other federal courts rendered similar decisions. At this point the Department of Justice decided to bring no further cases to trial until the United States Supreme Court should pass on the constitutionality of the law,\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"involved in their acquisition. But I have learned to my amazement that such is not the case. Not long ago I received one of the shocks of my life. Somewhat over two years ago a young woman came to work in our office. I supposed she had never heard, except casually, of the great scourge of the millinery trade in feathers. Since that time, however, she has been in daily touch with all the important efforts made in this country and abroad to {161} legislate the traffic out of existence, to guard from the plume hunters the colonies of Egrets\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"this specific purpose. This bill, besides extending protection to all useful {170} non-game birds, gave the first clear statutory terminology for defining \\\"game birds.\\\" It also provided for the issuing of permits for the collecting of wild birds and their eggs for scientific purposes. The States of New York and Massachusetts that year adopted the law. Arkansas followed eleven years later, but it was not until the Audubon Society workers took up the subject in 1909 that any special headway was made in getting States to pass this measure. To-day it is on the statute books of all the States\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"the eggs hatch, the ants gather the young plant lice and place them on plants. It may be seen, therefore, that the Flicker {110} by digging up ants' nests and feeding on the inhabitants has its value in an agricultural community. The Question of the Weed Seeds.\\u2014The work of the Chickadee, the Nighthawk, the Cuckoo, and the Flicker is only an example of the good being done by at least two-thirds of birds in the United States, and most of the remainder are not without their beneficial qualities. When the coming of winter brings a cessation of insect life, many\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"waving grain, typical of that spiritual harvest which should be associated in our minds with comfort and peace. A Birdless Cemetery.\\u2014I visited, not long ago, one of the old-time cemeteries, the pride of a neighbouring city. It was indeed a place of beauty to the eye; but to my mind there is always something flat and insipid about a landscape lacking the music of singing birds. Therefore I looked and listened for my feathered friends. Some English Sparrows flew up from the drive, and I heard the rusty hinge-like notes of a small company of Purple Crackles that were nesting,\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"they could live comfortably and cruise for several weeks; in fact, they were usually out during the entire three months of the nesting period. That was the time of year that offered best rewards for such work, for then the birds' {142} feathers bore their brightest lustre, and the birds being assembled on their nesting grounds they could easily be shot in great numbers. After the birds were killed the custom was to skin them, wash off the blood stains with benzine, and dry the feathers with plaster of Paris. Arsenic was used for curing and preserving the skins. Men\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"Warbler. Although in winter these birds range south to Panama, many remain as far north as New Jersey, Kansas, and the Ohio Valley. This does not mean that insects are found in these regions in sufficient numbers to supply the larder of the Myrtle Warblers, but it does mean that they find acceptable substitutes for their usual food. Oddly enough, what they depend on is not animal matter in any form, but consists of berries which contain some of the essential food properties of fatty meats. One of the most popular with them is the common bayberry. Among the sand\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"Egrets which he was paid to protect. I like to think of Greene as I saw him the last night in camp, his brown, lean face aglow with interest as he told me many things about the birds he guarded. The next day I was to leave him, and night after night he would sit by his fire, a lonely representative of the Audubon Society away down there on the edge of the Big Cypress, standing as best he could between the lives of the birds he loved and the insatiable greed of Fashion. The best place to study wild\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"hence is widely known as the Eaves Swallow. No rest of any kind in the form of a projecting beam is needed, as the bird skilfully fastens the mud to the vertical side of the barn close up under the overhanging roof. In such a situation it is usually safe from all beating rains. The Cliff Swallow has exhibited wisdom to no mean extent in exchanging the more or less exposed rocky ledge for the safety of sheltering eaves. Swallows show a decided tendency to gather in colonies in the breeding season. Under the eaves of a warehouse on the\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"every night. The island was small and perfectly barren, and any other method of attempted concealment would have failed utterly. Another time, while crouched among some boulders watching for a flock of Gambel's Quails to come to a water-hole in the Santa Catalina Mountains of Arizona, a Canyon Wren alighted on my back, for I was covered with an old tent fly so spotted with mildew that it closely resembled the neighbouring rocks. A moment later it flew to a point scarcely more than a foot from my face, when, after one terrified look, it departed. The Umbrella Blind.\\u2014A device\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"in short, the change is chiefly a psychological one. The gentleman doubtless does not see the birds as much as he did when he was a boy on a farm, or if he does, they do not make the same impression on his mind. It is but another example of the human tendency to regard all things as better in the \\\"good old times.\\\" Let us turn then from such well-meant but inaccurate testimony, and face the facts as they exist. I have no hesitation in saying that with many species of Finches, Warblers, Thrushes, and Wrens, their numbers in\"],\n [\"e\",\n\"and about four feet across the top. At this date it contained two fledglings perhaps three weeks old. Having been led to believe that Eagles were ferocious birds when their nests were approached, it was with feelings of relief that I noticed the parents flying about at long rifle-range. The female, which, as is usual with birds of prey, was the larger of the pair, once or twice swept within twenty yards of my head, but quickly veered off and resumed her former action of beating back and forth over the tree-tops two hundred yards away.
