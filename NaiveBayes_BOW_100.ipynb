Twelve o’clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded very gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a small man crouching against the pillars of the portico. “Are you come from Dr. Jekyll?” I asked. He told me “yes” by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him enter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th id=\"T_b7939_level0_row74\" class=\"row_heading level0 row74\" >74</th>\n","      <td id=\"T_b7939_row74_col0\" class=\"data row74 col0\" >74</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_b7939_row74_col1\" class=\"data row74 col1\" >a</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_b7939_row74_col2\" class=\"data row74 col2\" >have been thinking of the will?” But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address. “And now,” said the other, “how did you know me?” “By description,” was the reply. “Whose description?” “We have common friends,” said Mr. Utterson. “Common friends,” echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. “Who are they?” “Jekyll, for instance,” said the lawyer. “He never told you,” cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. “I did not think you would have lied.” “Come,” said Mr. Utterson, “that is not fitting language.” The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th id=\"T_b7939_level0_row75\" class=\"row_heading level0 row75\" >75</th>\n","      <td id=\"T_b7939_row75_col0\" class=\"data row75 col0\" >75</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_b7939_row75_col1\" class=\"data row75 col1\" >a</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_b7939_row75_col2\" class=\"data row75 col2\" >like my neighbours; and then I smiled, comparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will with the lazy cruelty of their neglect.

They collected in enormous colonies for the purpose of rearing their young, and after the forests of the Northern States were so largely destroyed the birds seem to have been driven far up into Canada, quite {129} beyond their usual breeding range.

Woodpeckers have strong, chisel-shaped bills and are able to excavate nesting cavities, but there are others that do not possess such tools.

Character of Material Used.—A wide variety of material is used by birds that build open nests. Cotton and feathers enter largely into the composition of the lining of a Shrike's nest. In Florida the Mockingbird shows a decided preference for the withered leaves and stems of life-everlasting, better known as the plant that produces \"rabbit tobacco.\" The nest of the Summer Tanager is made almost entirely of grasses, the outer half being green,</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th id=\"T_b7939_level0_row985\" class=\"row_heading level0 row985\" >985</th>\n","      <td id=\"T_b7939_row985_col0\" class=\"data row985 col0\" >985</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_b7939_row985_col1\" class=\"data row985 col1\" >e</td>\n","      <td id=\"T_b7939_row985_col2\" class=\"data row985 col2\" >the lake.
